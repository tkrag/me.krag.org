					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad to hear you finally got to go rafting.  My daughter is going on a trip with an episcopal youth group to paint a church in Xalapa she is 15 and I was wondering what you thought of the safety of the town. Could you give me some info and if you know about the roads from Mexico City to Xalapa, Vera Cruz.  She is flying from Houston to Mex. City and then taking a so called &quot;first class&quot; bus tour company bus. Is there really such a thing?

I would really appreciate your knowledge.  

Thanks,

Carol]]></description>
