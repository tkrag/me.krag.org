					<description><![CDATA[For once in my life I&#039;ve never heard of one African country that is peaceful, what I would like to say is to give blessigs to people in Ghana that, they must atleast allow or show people from outside their borders, on how they live in such a peaceful country, may the glory of God fell down upon Ghana and the rest of Africa, as some countries within this continent such as Liberia stop fighting, what is it that one will achieve from killing his/her family and friends?  how will tomorrow look if the tomorrow leaders are killled or destroyed? finally what do we achieve from war, only delapidated buildings and sorrow, as to start something from the begginning is not easy to start, as it requires some efforts, commitment, and dedication. I just wish I had the powers to stop rebel movements or terrorists from indulging into war, because war is nothing either than Hell itself, OH! GOD what have we done to deserve such sufferings, because you said let there be peace on Earth as it is in Haven.Thank you.]]></description>
