					<description><![CDATA[President Bush had some good things to say in his Adress. I applaud him for his stands for human dignity, he&#039;s against cloning and against abortion. His ideas of bettering mentor programs are very honorable, not that we don&#039;t already have relatively good mentoring programs, even though I don&#039;t think that he really needs to spend all that money on it. It just needs to be encouraged to become a mentor.  What I don&#039;t get is: he wants to get rid of taxes, but he wants to spend billions of dollars on implementing his good ideas. My question: where the hell is he going to get the money from? 
In response to the half hour given to the war talks:  I firmly believe that there has to be a peaceful reselution between the U.S. and Iraq. Is it really so hard to believe that Iraq maybe really doesn&#039;t have weapons of mass destruction, the ones that the U.S. gave them. And why is Bush so adamant about going to war with Iraq, yet North Korea actually told us that they have nuclear weapons and Bush just says to that, &quot;We will not be Blackmailed!&quot;?!?! I think that we are going to have another Korean or Vietnam war, were a lot of innocent people will loose theire lives over somthing they don&#039;t believe in. How are we supposed to teach children they shouldn&#039;t use violence to solve theire problems with other people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I&#039;ve seen posted here so far looks like it&#039;s been written by people who never bothered to learn how to spell correctly, which leads me to believe that their view on the war issue is also tainted by ignorance.  They all sound pretty young, I bet none of them are actual combat veterans.  No veteran in his/her right mind would have such a naive opinion about Sadam Hussein.  Anybody with any life experience can see it coming, Sadam will not be a pussycat.  When he has the capability to strike, he will not hesitate to do so.  And the people who are insisting that we can trust a man like Sadam who tortures and kills his own countrymen (including women and children) will be the first ones to cry: &quot;Why didn&#039;t we do something about it before it was too late?&quot;  Wake up and smell the coffee, this is REAL life, not some naive, idealistic nirvana you live in!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[well.. i think people were playing a joke on his speaking disability, and quite frankly i find president bush  just a little boy who&#039;s toy broke, and now won&#039;t give up until he satisfies his need for revenge.... sides whatever he is doing, he ISN&quot;T helping the state of our foreign affairs, what good we have is now going down the drain, and not to mention that before he meddles in the affair of OTHER countries, maybe he should first fix the problems in his own country first, just because he&#039;s president doesn&#039;t give him the right to act any differently then a normal everyday person!! and by the way, NAIVE?! NAIVE?! if you want to live in a world torn apart war, and pain and grief, then feel free, but don&#039;t go calling the people who still believe in peace naive, just because you have turned bitter and blinded by this so called war strike for the better of america, well i have one question, what about the world huh? we aren&#039;t the only ones on this planet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[President Bush is going to be aiding alot of good programs that I think are spetacular.  He is spending alot of money, which is fine, but what I don&#039;t agree with is how he is going to get the money.  I do not agree with the defict theroy, I believe that you need to tax to support the programs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[President Bush made a very good speech that was very clear and straight to the point, all of his ideas are great however they&#039;re costly and we can only do so much at a time, he is not superman and can not save the world.  We would all love to live in a tax-free world but that simply can not happen, the money needs to come from somewhere and it&#039;s going to be a long process to do everything Bush has proposed.  As for cloning and aboriton I as an individual completely am against however it should be the choice of the human being.  We all have different aspects on life and we need to look at it in different points of view. However, we do know that Iraq does in fact have biological and chemical happens and we need to act on that before America is seriously in danger.  They have shown no evidence that they have rid of the weapons.]]></description>
