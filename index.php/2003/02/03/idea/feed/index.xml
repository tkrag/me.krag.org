					<description><![CDATA[In general i agree, but sometimes it&#039;s the things we do for the wrong reasons ;-) In other words, if i end up doing work that already exists, or is inherently useless to people then there are other things i&#039;d rather do...

(they include travelling to strange places, lying on the beach, reading good science fiction, and genereally being mostly harmless).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A couple of mercenary points... You might want to find out whether you will be accepted to MIT first. If they take you then you might need to spend that time making money to support yourself. Try to find out if there are any foundations etc which might pay you to do it or at least publish it somewhere where it would be most likely to be read. And see if publishing something like that would help you with future applications to universities etc.

Also, why not consider doing your Masters somewhere in Europe where (if the UK is a guide) it only takes a year to do?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The first goes without saying. If I&#039;m going to go study next year, I&#039;ll do my thinking and contemplating there. 

Regarding nthe publishing, that was one of the hopes I had when asking the &#039;community&#039; is there an interest in this sort of thing, would it reach any readers, and fullfill a demand? Does anyone, apart from those of use academically interested, in fact care about all the arguments?

Whether it helps with future applications to universities worries me less. I would do it because it made sense to some people, and because I belive I can pull it off. The respect and interest of people like you, David, is worth a lot more to me than a university slot.

Regarding the Masters, I think the UK is the only place (I know of) where a masters is a one year ordeal. There are essentially two reason why I applied to the MIT Media Lab. Primarily it is the only place where they do hands-on projects with ICTs in development, and while I could easily imagine spending 2 months understanding the state-of-the-art in the sector, I couldn&#039;t imagine doing a truly useful project without some degree of hands-on on the ground implementation. There just aren&#039;t enough projects in the area that interests me to do a succesful study without doing some hands on work as well.
Secondly, Cambridge, Mass. with the MIT Media Lab, the Sloan School of Management, Harvard Business school and very importantly The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, is a extremely happening place in the ICT for Development arena. There are so many hyper-intelligent people working with these issues (and I know quite a few of them), that I figure it would be impossible to go there and NOT get inspired. 

That said, I just recently noticed the program at LSE, where David is a student, MSc in New Media, Information and Society, which may be interesting in itself.]]></description>
