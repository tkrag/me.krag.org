					<description><![CDATA[Tomas,

I was indeed beginning to worry!  Where&#039;s Tomas?  Why no posts at multiplicity?  Should I email him?

I for one am glad you&#039;re back after the short hiatus and also glad we have people like you on the planet taking on difficult challenges and trying to improve people&#039;s lives through technology.

Please don&#039;t let the occasional frustration get in the way of your work and convictions that drive it -- your efforts help us who learn and watch them (by reading your web log, among other things...) gain from your unique experience, come up with our own new ideas based on your efforts, and adjust all of our thoughts and strategies accordingly. 

Those of us who have the nerve to self-contemplate deal with the double-edged sword of nagging doubts accompanied by periodic insight.  I get a lot out of your thoughts and experiences and I look forward to reading more.
