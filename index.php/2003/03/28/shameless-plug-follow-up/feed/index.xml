					<description><![CDATA[David,

those are valid points, and although the article makes it sound like that info came from me, I never made such claims. 

On the other hand, I believe that while VoIP is an insignificantly small part of the reason, e-mail, IM and other internet-based media are replacing telephones and faxes for things like business-communication. That would be part of the reason that number of spoken minutes are dropping.

On the quality of infrastructure that is probably the result of lack of maintenance. Ghana Telecom is basically cashless, and has absolutely no possibility of maintaining the network. And telecom infrastructure on a national level degrades pretty quickly without maintenance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi There,

I happened onto your site by accident and have enjoyed looking around.  It occurs to me that we should perhaps speak together about some potential business.

Our company ATMC is the world leader in international operator-assisted calling services.  We work with PTT&#039;s directly, processing mostly international collect calls for them.  They love us because we pay them a lot for calls that they would otherwise just get the settlement rate for, and we do a terrific job.  

Your connections with telco&#039;s in poor countries, like Ghana, could be most valuable to you if you brought in some collect calling business from them.

If you want to explore this, or perhaps know someone that this would make sense to, please call me.  

Best Regards,

Josh Urbach
