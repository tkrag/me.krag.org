					<description><![CDATA[Well I think there was a certain amount of America bashing in Bill&#039;s article and that&#039;s partly why I always protest now when people say that Open Spectrum is deregulation. Because if people get this idea that Open Spectrum is this big american capitalism festival to force them to deregulate and then get screwed over like has happened so many times in the past, then they will be opposed to Open Spectrum for a wrong reason. Because I have seen anti-Americanism in response to my ideas about spreading more Open Spectrum.

I think you&#039;re right there&#039;s some uncertainty. Although it&#039;s a lot less certain now than it was 10-15 years ago when it was the &quot;junk band&quot; now there&#039;s portable phones, wi-fi, etc.

Still I don&#039;t see there as being a huge cost to the government I doubt that they are making megabucks off these piddly license fees in 2.4 GHz anyway. And we already know, that places that allow open spectrum Wi-Fi wISPs hae a big increase in internet activity. Surely there must be some research or something.

					<description><![CDATA[Simon,

The cost I am talking about is not the cost of lost license-fee&#039;s, but rather the cost of lost telecommunications fee&#039;s as more and more traffic moves away from the government telco, and onto uncontrolled, and largely uncontrollable ISP networks. 

Many developing countries get a significant portion of their foreign exchange from ex-pat&#039;s calling their families and friends at home. 

And while we agree that cheaper and better communications networks are as a rule always going to be better for a society, that is a medium- to long-term consideration many countries can ill afford, as long as their state-coffers are too empty to provide schooling and health-care to the people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t really see the telecomm business as being a profitable one long-term any more. I think that governments in Africa that think that they will be able to keep reaping those profits are ill advised. It&#039;s not going to pay for anything.

Given that reality, developing the alternate infrastructure is a no brainer.

How long do you think it will take for the government to reap the economic benefits from Wi-Fi etc.?
