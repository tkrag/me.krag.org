					<description><![CDATA[In general terms, i agree. however, there still problems. for instance, i installed OO on my iBook and it runs on top of the XDarwin window system and OroborOSX. unfortunately, this makes it very slow and cumbersome when compared to the 3secs that MS takes to launch. 

while stil at the camp, i read in /. that the next version of MS will not interoperate with OO, and thus anyone trying to open MS files with OO will be an outlaw. what rubbish. absurd! the OO dev community &#039;d better work on these flaws so that the next version of OO, regardless of platform, will be as solid and robust as a rock. 

my 2 eurocents

					<description><![CDATA[While at work I deal with MS prods. At home, OO. I love the play and counterplay of those two, and being convinced of the benefits of OO, both socially and economically, I agree on its superiority. But it has to attract much more than just the casual user to be a real alternative, instead of an exotic curiousity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As far as it goes with editing the documents, OO is working well. There is of course a problem with MS compatibility - Impress sucks at Power Point files veeery badly. But the more important thing for OO to become a widely used application is availability of enterprise level applications which integrate with OO suite. I would really look forward to something like Knowledege Management or a Workflow system based on OO.

Maybe OOs real superiority will emerge from it&#039;s multiple programming language bindings for creating extensions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi there! 

i know it&#039;s been nearly a year since this entry was posted, yet i know you&#039;re being notified of new messages posted here, and i have fresh information regarding the OO mess i described above in the first reply to your entry, so...here goes:

louis-suarez potts, community manager of OO, told me that the /. piece was most certainly FUD, and there should be no uncertainty as to whether the next version of MSoffice will interoperate with OO. It will. And he also told me the new new release of OO for macosx runs like any other app, thus eliminating the need to run it through X11. Very good piece of news, both in a technical and business-wise/political sense, if you ask me:-)]]></description>
