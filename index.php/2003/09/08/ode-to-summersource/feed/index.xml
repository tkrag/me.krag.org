					<description><![CDATA[Hello Tomas, 

the camp was a blast indeed! made new friends - of which i hope you&#039;re one - and learnt so much in the process, let alone the mediterenean paradise that Vis actually is:-)

there so many thoughts and ideas that will certainly take some time to settle, and it&#039;ll be damn hard resuming back to normal life! i&#039;ll make sure tham my next beer and spliff is dedicated to tac-tech-col-, gunner, vis, and everyone who made the camp what it really was, and look forward to seeing you again. 

i&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be a next time, especially given that i&#039;ve just applied for a research job at the Compenhagen Business School. So, fingers crossed!

keep in touch

					<description><![CDATA[Tomas,

I too was bewildered and dazed sometimes. Your stream-of-conciousness meets mine. Thanks for this. You can be sure that you will here from me someday... You are now my wireless guru.

Three cheers for the camp and everybody who was there!! Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah!

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Tomas,

Some truly apt poetry for an amazing week, and thanks for your enthusiasm! If you&#039;re ever looking for new challenges or interesting holidays, there&#039;s always place in South Africa.

Here&#039;s to free beer, football and wireless cucumbers!
