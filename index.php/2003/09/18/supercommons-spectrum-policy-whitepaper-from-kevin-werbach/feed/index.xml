					<description><![CDATA[I had no idea you were coming to my homeland! When are you coming, and how have you planned your holiday? It sure would be nice to see you! Are you thinking of coming to Crete, or are you spending all of your holiday in the mainlands, or some other greek island anyway? 

there&#039;s a slim chance of my being away to the UK for the next 10 or so days, but that&#039;s not definite yet. let me know if you fancy coming to crete.

funny thing is i had just started contemplating the idea of wi-fi-ing the capital (heraklion) of my island:-) Not that help is in short supply (a friend from belgium is coming to help with the implementation details), but discussing those ideas with you would make perfect sense, let alone all the fun we&#039;d have. 

Come for the crack dude!]]></description>
