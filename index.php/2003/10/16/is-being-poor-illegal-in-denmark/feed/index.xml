Suppose the tax authorities decide that you spent at least 75.000 kr and make you pay taxes for that amount. But you actually had a huge illegal business, and actually made 1.000.000 kr. Wait 1 year for the state of limitations to kick in, and they&#039;ll never be able to tax your 925.000 kr again.
