					<description><![CDATA[This was pretty much the role of the Internet Societal Task Force (ISTF), the abandoned child of the Internet Society (ISOC) who&#039;s role was initially conceived as a task force to identify and then try to fix these local problems using only the power of the internet to connect with the local people, share everyone&#039;s experience, help in whatever way the grassroots workers thought they might need.

it hasn&#039;t been wildly successful.  I don&#039;t know if it had anything to do with our political initiatives post 9-11 in trying to retain internet access in nations where the US gov&#039;t was disconnnecting &quot;terrorism-linked&quot; ISPs, or maybe it was just because we were loud and unruly, but ISOC demoted us from a Task Force to a Discussion Group.

But we push on because, like you, we think change can work if we the little people just take the bull by the horns ourselves and do what we can.
