					<description><![CDATA[I know exactly where you are coming from but just wanted to say that every so often we get reminded of why we are doing what we do.Mine happened a couple of days ago when i found this on indymedia Brazil:

Part of an open letter wriiten as the State Police , the Federal Police, and the Army
prepared an armed operation involving 600 men, two helicopters, and two planes, to remove 
3000 guaranis from the Guarani-Nhandeva and Guarani-Caiová tribes from the 14 farms they took over 
in an area recognised as an indigenous area by the Brazilian government.....

“We want only what is ours, that is our right to have, which is our land, we are not invading the farms, we 
are only ocupying our lands, we only want to plant and harvest our food, and live in peace in our yuy katu. 
If it is necessary we will give our own lives for this, wash our yvy katu with our blood, because that is the 
way it always was, there is no place in Brazil that does not have blood marks from the indigenous people who 
gave their lives and shared their blood fighting for their rights and for their land.” 

.......Mato Grosso do Sul ,January 2004

 and then my worries about money,direction bla bla bla pale into insignificance.I hope this gives you something to think about when you are on vacation and massive respect for what you are trying to achieve
