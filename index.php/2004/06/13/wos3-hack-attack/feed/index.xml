					<description><![CDATA[I am really sorry for the problems our &quot;marketing&quot;/hacking department created. They got a bit too excited hyping the dotcom. I wasn&#039;t too happy about it either, it was fun the first 5 minutes but then got out of hand, my Firebird Google bar sent me to this lousy designed interface of ours.

My problem was that everything got out of control, the designers created strange art, the slashdot crowd spammed (!) my paypal account with money, my email inbox was flooded with questions and job applications, so I really had a hard time controlling things.

I am really sorry, I didn&#039;t want to the abuse power like we did. The WOS3 conference covers really important things so it shouldn&#039;t be taken too lightly.
