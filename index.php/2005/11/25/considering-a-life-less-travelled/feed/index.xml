					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I spend a great deal of time in Brazil.  They are a people that know how to live life in the moment.  It has had a great effect on me.  I am more relaxed and stress free while here.  Life is getting shorter every day and I have decided that I don&#039;t want to let it pass me by.  Thanks for your Blog.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Overheard at a party:

&quot;Follow your heart.  Then the worst can will happen is that you will die.&quot;

My life also seems to incorporate an ongoing theme of freedom-vs.-security.  I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;m happiest and most effective when I simply do what I need to do, and Universe seems to provide whatever I really need, &quot;just in time&quot;.  Chasing what I think I need seems about as futile as chasing a photon.

I know you&#039;ll find the balance that works for you.]]></description>
