					<description><![CDATA[Max, that&#039;s a good point, and to a certain degree just strengthens my point that there are potential security issues that need to be dealt with in these scenario&#039;s, and since most Fon users cannot be expected to be able to properly setup iptables, this is a non-trivial issue. I think my point with the multiple VLAN&#039;s was meant to be that, with that feature, and some good default firewall rules it is possible to make a reasonably secure segregation of traffic, something that simply isn&#039;t possible with a standard (cheap) DSL router or modem and a single Linksys box for wireless (at least not without some tunneling or VPN).

cheers

					<description><![CDATA[Well, seperating the LAN from the WLAN via VLANs doesn&#039;t really protect the access to a local network when the router&#039;s WAN is connected to a local network itself.

To protect this local network I blocked access via WLAN to every private IP possible in the router&#039;s firewall (using iptables).

This way a local network cannot be accessed via WLAN at all.

Cheers, Max]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, i am by no means a security expert, but I think the Man-in-the-middle challenge is more complicated than simple authentication. First of all, a Rogue AP could offer up a fake captive portal page (copied from the real network) in what is very similar to a phishing attack, except that (because the rogue AP controls DNS) it isn&#039;t even visible in the URL. Using https with a &quot;real&quot; certificate, would mean that the user would get a certificate warning in their browser when accessing the fake captive portal page, but having set-up lots of chillispot auth systems with self-signed certificates, I can pretty safely say that most users would just accept the self-signed certficate, because they assume they are on a good network.

The other way this can be done, is for someone to setup a machine with 2 radios as a transparent bridge between the user and the real access point (using the same essid, but with a stronger radio), and let all the auth happen through the transparent bridge, and just passively sniffing traffic until the user goes to an interesting web-page, i.e. their bank, at which point the transparent bridge becomes a web proxy that accepts the password on behalf of the user and passes it on to the actual bank. 

I am sure there are ways to deal with these issues, that do not require tunneling through the AP, but i have a hard time seeing what would be more trust-worthy than tunneling back to a piece equipment you trust, i.e. your own access point. 

I realize that your access point may be compromised as well, and that truly each tunnel should go to the end-point server where that servic is being accessed, but that seems fairly unrealistic to me, compared to the simpler solution of just creating a tunnel.

cheers

Hey Thomas.  At ISF we seperate wireless traffic from the LAN so that our members can&#039;t access the owner&#039;s network.  The linksys will let you set up different networks on each interface.  I imagine you already know that.  But we can&#039;t seperate members&#039; wireless traffic from the owner&#039;s wireless traffic.

Also - re: man in the middle - What about authetification.  I know that it was a big deal when we designed wifidog that our hotspots *would not* be able to catch the authentification information of our users.  User authenticates with the central server in a way that the hotspot owner can&#039;t eavesdrop.]]></description>
