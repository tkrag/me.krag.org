We lost the final by conceding a goal with 1.9 seconds left, which left a bitter taste, but in retrospect, being the second best team in the country isn&#8217;t too shabby.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> a lot has happened in the year since I last blogged regularly. I I honestly expect most of my readers to have been shaken off by the 1 year hiatus, and the finality of <a href="http://multiplicity.dk/2004/09/last-chance-to-see-wireless4development-is-happening/">my parting statement</a>.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s fine, because then I can go back to blogging for an exclusive readership of me and my invisible friend. </p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d start off with an update on what&#8217;s been going on outside my professional life over the past year.<br />
<span id="more-474"></span><br />
As many of you know, I&#8217;ve had recurring problems and multiple surgeries in the left knee, preventing me from playing basketball, and hence stopping me from keeping in shape in a fun meaningful way.<br />
Until now at least. </p>
<p>In october last year I started playing <a href="http://www.canoepolo.com/index.php?">Canoepolo</a>, which is often known as kajakpolo (at least in Denmark), and I&#8217;ve completely fallen in love with the game. It has all the excitement, physical hardship and pace of hoops, with my knee in a static position in a kajak. And it&#8217;s on the water.  wow!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of me at a recent tournament, which was part of the danish championship series this summer (my team finsihed 2nd in the 2nd best division).</p>
