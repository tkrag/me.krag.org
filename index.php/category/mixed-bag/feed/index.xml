										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night around midnight I was chatting with <a href="http://ethanzuckermann.com/" target="_parent">Ethan</a>, friend and fellow <a href="http://bacontarian.com/" target="_parent">bacontarian</a>, and he notified me of his <a href="http://bacontarian.com/?p=45" target="_parent">latest post</a> to bacontarian. </p>
<p>It is an attempt at unifying the concept of bacontarianism with the new and fastly expaning religion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastafarianism" target="_parent">pastafarianism</a> (the belief that the world was created by the Flying Spaghetti Monster).</p>
<p>He submitted the post, and then proceeded to let our friends at <a href="http://boingboing.net/" target="_parent">boingboing</a> know about it. Which of course is a perfectly sane thing to do. </p>
<p>Let me stress this, the problem is not with Ethan&#8217;s actions, but with the little known fact that the server running bacontarian.com (as well as this site) is an ancient 1GHz machine running OpenBSD out of a small basement room underneath our office. It runs a good 50 domains for web, as well as delivering mail for about 20 people, and is connected to the internet through a <a href="http://firkantnet.dk/" target="_parent">community fiber network</a> here in Copenhagen. It&#8217;s obviously not built to be boingboinged.</p>
<p>Long story short. I pretty much knew that when I got up this morning, the first thing I&#8217;d have to do would be to bike to the office to give the little beast a kick. </p>
<p>And I did, </p>
<p>and it&#8217;s back up</p>
<p>and i hope it stays up for a while&#8230;..</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> a lot has happened in the year since I last blogged regularly. I I honestly expect most of my readers to have been shaken off by the 1 year hiatus, and the finality of <a href="http://multiplicity.dk/2004/09/last-chance-to-see-wireless4development-is-happening/">my parting statement</a>.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s fine, because then I can go back to blogging for an exclusive readership of me and my invisible friend. </p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d start off with an update on what&#8217;s been going on outside my professional life over the past year.<br />
<span id="more-474"></span><br />
As many of you know, I&#8217;ve had recurring problems and multiple surgeries in the left knee, preventing me from playing basketball, and hence stopping me from keeping in shape in a fun meaningful way.<br />
Until now at least. </p>
<p>In october last year I started playing <a href="http://www.canoepolo.com/index.php?">Canoepolo</a>, which is often known as kajakpolo (at least in Denmark), and I&#8217;ve completely fallen in love with the game. It has all the excitement, physical hardship and pace of hoops, with my knee in a static position in a kajak. And it&#8217;s on the water.  wow!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of me at a recent tournament, which was part of the danish championship series this summer (my team finsihed 2nd in the 2nd best division).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well mine wasn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ve ever wanted that, in fact i&#8217;ve often shied away from it, during the dot-com  heydey, and consciously chosen the boring default. I&#8217;m not sure why exactly, whether it&#8217;s sharing a name with the unbelieving apostle, cowardice, conveniene or just high resilience to bs.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t really matter after all, the point I wanted to make was that I never dreamed of being my own boss, i would have been contented working for other people all my life. in fact I think I would mostly prefer to be part of a team, with limited responsibility for having to make it all make sense (and money). </p>
<p>Yet here I am, running a small non-profit with Sebastian. Responsible for my own destiny, our success, and a lot of other high-brow things.  It just happened this way. I found the ideal business in ict&#8217;s for the developing world, in which i had more fun, more fullfillment, and more interesting challenges in 3 month than i would have in a year of web agency, dot-not mayhem. I knew that that was what i wanted to work with, and i took the only path that presented itself to me. being my own boss.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s haunting me now. I can&#8217;t help but feel misplaced in so many ways. I can&#8217;t help but dream of having a regular job, with colleagues, limited responsibility, and the ability to run away screaming if it all becomes too much. Perhaps that&#8217;s really what it is, a fear of being trapped. trapped in a construct i invented, trapped in a job that i don&#8217;t really want, but can&#8217;t run away from, because that would be running away from myself and my dream. </p>
<p>i think that&#8217;s probably a large part of it. it&#8217;s a responsibility i never wanted, but having taken it upon myself, despite this fat, i need to deal with it or find a way out that leaves at least a few bridges standing. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 9 months ago, Signe and I planned a 3 week vacation in April to go visit our very close friends in Vancouver, hike, kayak and generally recover from what I was expecting to be a fairly exhausting winter of work. </p>
<p>instead it has been a fairly exhausting winter of travel, with quite a few health problems mixed in for good measure. I feel like I haven&#8217;t had a full work week at the office since early december, and it&#8217;s not really a feeling i relish, since there is so much to do, and we are finally getting somewhere with oyur own projects here.<br />
<span id="more-453"></span><br />
So for a short while a few weeks ago, we talked about cancelling our vacation, and trying to postpone it for later this year. My knee is still acting up from the surgery I had in december, and my back, while almost infinitely better is still not perfect, so we thought about waiting with the active outdoor vacation until things were calmer.<br />
The truth is, though, that starting this summer, we are really going to be pushing the Wireless Roadshow and by late summer, early fall, if all goes well, i will be on the road more or less constantly for a while. So the chances of postponing a vacation this year seemed slim to none. </p>
<p>At the same time, I sort of had this feeling that after a winter that was pretty tough emotionally, for both of us, and physically, for me, it might not be a bad idea to relax together for a few weeks, get to know each other again, and spend some time talking about our common dreams and hopes for the future. And I&#8217;m so far behind with my work anyway, that anything that waited this long, will safely wait another 3 weeks. </p>
<p>So here we go, off on vacation to British Columbia, Canada. To visit friends, hike, and perhaps even kayak. To recover and prepare for a travel intense, busy year ahead. And to stay away from the Grizzlies&#8230;..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not expecting to blog for the next 3 weeks, so I wish you all a good 3 weeks, and here are links to some of my favourite blogs to keep you entertained until then:</p>
