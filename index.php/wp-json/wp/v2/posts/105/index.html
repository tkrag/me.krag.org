Highly implausible, but given the fact that they claim pending patents as a reason not to do peer reviews or otherwise give details on the technology, I am obliged to yell &#8220;HOAX!&#8221; here!<br \/>\nPerfect Compression refers to a compression technology that can compress any string of data, including its own output, meaning it can in theory continuously compress data until all data can be compressed to a single bit. Enough said.<br \/>\nHowever if they have developed a new form of compression technology, and against all reason are capable of reaching compression ratios in the 1 to 100 range, and even if it isn&#8217;t &#8220;Perfect Compression&#8221;, it could have profound effect on the world of Last-mile delivery, probably boosting existing GSM and CDMA based Data-channels in importance compared to 802.11b.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.zeosync.com\/flash\/pressrelease.htm\">ZeoSync Press Release<\/a><\/p>\n<div CLASS=\"item\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<p>802.11b is still gaining ground. In the all important US market most analysts now agree that the competing HomeRF standard is more or less dead, leaving the IEEE standards to rule the last mile wireless space. That should secure cheap mass-produced hardware for the bandwidth-starving masses.<\/p>\n<div CLASS=\"item\">&nbsp;<\/div>\n<p>And from a Danish perspective Telia&#8217;s Swedish <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homerun.telia.com\/\">Homerun<\/a> project could be of interest. Using the Wi-Fi standardisation (802.11b) they are offering subscription-based Internet access around Scandinavia. The first 2 danish base stations are running, one at the airport in Kastrup, and another at the First Hotel on Vesterbrogade. Ideal for the travelling business man with a WLAN laptop, it gives access speeds far higher than anything you can hope for on a measly modem. Using their position as a mobile operator in Sweden it is now possible to identify the nearest Base Station by using Telia&#8217;s location-based mobile services. As a Telia mobile subscriber, simple SMS to the Yellow Pages (conveniently owned by Telia) returns the location of the nearest HomeRun base station. It&#8217;s nice to see the first initiatives in 802.11b that affect Danmark, even if it is just a little bump on a Swedish network.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Perfect Compression : Californian company Zeosync claim to have a perfect compression technology, which can compress any bit of data in a 1 to 100 ratio.
