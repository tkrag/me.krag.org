My interests lie somewhere in thr vacuum between wireless technologies, open-source systems,  and IT in the developing world. <\/p>\n<p>I really want to, no need to work with developing world problems, but there is the basic necessity of making money, and the desire to geek out from time to time. Get involved with technology, the immediate satisfaction of getting something to work, versus the long-term startegic philosophising of so many other projects. <\/p>\n<p>So to boost my chances of making a living as a consultant in the Danish Internet world, while pursuing developing world projects, i&#8217;ve decided to attempt writing a weblog specifically on wireless technologies, and specifically from a danish perspective. There really isn&#8217;t an idependent view of what&#8217;s happening with mobile Internet, wireless ethernet, and related technologies and applications in Denmark.<br \/>\nThe biggest issue is whether or not I can find the time to update it regularly, and of course whether I can find an interested group of readers here.<br \/>\nThe blog is in english, to make it easier for the world at large, that is if they have any interest in this sort of thing. You can find the first installments on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mostlyharmless.dk\/\">Mostly Harmless<\/a> webpage or directly at <a href=\"http:\/\/wireless.mostlyharmless.dk\/\">http:\/\/wireless.mostlyharmless.dk\/<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>In terms of projects, I am still working with my good friend and former colleague Sebastian on an action plan for developing technologies specifically for developing world markets, starting of with a solar or wind powered 802.11b base station and linux community server. And I&#8217;m also working with another good friend and former colleague, Charlotte, on starting a think Tank for IT people with a Social Conscience. Well, that&#8217;s the working title, and exactly waht it will contain is as yet completely unknown, but at the very least a forum for discussing and getting feedback on these absurd projects I keep getting involved in.<\/p>\n<p>And Remember: &#8220;In this day and age, the only thing that gives you more freedom than loads of money is the realization that you don&#8217;t need money!&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Next to my job here at Pink Floor, I&#8217;ve been working on a few projects of my own.
