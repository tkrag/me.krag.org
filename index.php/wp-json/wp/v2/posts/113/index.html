It&#8217;s not only small enough to hold in your hand, but is actually designed to use with one hand, via a (sony inspired?) scroll-wheel and three buttons on the side of the device. With it&#8217;s 32 Mb RAM and 16 Mb ROM, small greyscale display built-in e-mail and synchronization, as well as MMC (MultiMedia Card) and SD (Secure Digital) extension slots, it seems to share a number of features with certain PalmOS based computers. The fact that it&#8217;s Linux based, of course, is relevant in terms of availability of 3rd party software. <\/p>\n<p>2 big unanswered questions remain. Will it be extensible with 802.11b, or GPRS wireless connectivity? And what kind of battery time do you get in such a small device running an Intel StrongARM 133MHz processor, and Linux?<br \/>\nWell, it&#8217;s due out in April, after presentation at this years CeBit in Hannover, so we&#8217;ll see what kind of performance you get at the expected price of  649 Euro&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>I like the size of it though.<\/p>\n<div class='item'>.<\/div>\n<p><strong>An Orange future<\/strong> &#8211; today <a href=\"http:\/\/www.orange.se\/\">Orange Sweden<\/a> announced a prototype Music service for 3G mobile phones.
