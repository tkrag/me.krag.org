As usual theres a wish list <a href=\"http:\/\/www.krag.org\/Blog\/wishlist.shtml\">here<\/a>, for those that care, or those that are just plain curious what I have come up with this time. <\/p>\n<p>Apart from the fact that I&#8217;m getting older (as usual) and my hair-line is receding (as usual) and there&#8217;s a good bit of aggresive energy at work (more than usual), caused by deadlines looming like mountains on the horizon, I&#8217;m really quite well.<br \/>\nA number of my more esoteric, altruistic projects are moving along, while others seem to have ground to a complete halt. I have (not for the first time) completely given up any ideas of becoming a sophist or even a nihilist to ease my mind of growing worries that the world I happen to inhabit is indeed a fucked up place full of egotistical maniacs with entirely too much power.<\/p>\n<p>The new Danish governments pretty obvious attempt at &#8216;cleaning&#8217; Denmark of too many foreign influences.<br \/>\nThe infamous G.W. Bush&#8217;es strange meanderings into Cuban politics to avoid extending any human (or civil) rights to the admittedly not-so-nice &#8216;enemy&#8217;.<br \/>\nThe misery of world poverty, lack of tolerance and general stupidity.<br \/>\nAll these, and many more things, leave me numbed and slightly depresed, now that flirts with various forms of not caring have been tossed down the drain. The fact is, I do care, and that ca be pretty tough.<\/p>\n<p>I have to say that  last nights trip to the Computer Game Cafe, down the street, with a handful of friends for a serious battle of Counter-Strike helped release some of the agression.
