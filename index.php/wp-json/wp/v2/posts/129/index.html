A PC-card which includes HSCSD, GPRS and 802.11b, effectively moots the necessity for 3G as an effective means of data communication for business users. Instead of paying presumably high fees to roam on a 3G network that needs a lot of cells to give seamless communications, users will be able to use the lower speeds of GPRS when away from the office, and the higher speeds of 802.11b at the airport, the hotel or the office.<br \/>\nThe card should be available sometime This summer, and I want one. If anybody wants to make a compact Flash version for a PDA, please, I&#8217;ll get that too.<\/p>\n<p>Why would I want to wait for operators to launch their 3G networks, get their roaming agreements in place, and then pay a high premium price to cover the costs of 3G licenses and equipment, when many airports and hotels are already getting WiFi (802.11b) hotspots, and I can add my own hotspots at home and at the office for less than ? 500.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finally.
