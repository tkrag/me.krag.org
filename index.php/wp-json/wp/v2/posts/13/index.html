XP rocks, but i guess, any way you turn it, there is something geekish, and slightly scary about a kid in his mid-twenties sitting at the office at 2200 hours reading up on the latest in software methodology. whew! that brought the sweat of a mid-life geek-crisis to my forehead \ud83d\ude42<br \/>\nwhat the f&#8230; i have to admit it fascinates me, this xp stuff. countering some of the very fundamentals, that are the basis of most other software methodologies, it has a point. it&#8217;s very peter naur, if anybody knows what i&#8217;m refering to.<\/p>\n<p>i really hope i get the chance to work somewhere where xp is an experimental reality. somewhere, where i have the freedom to try it, and make people belive it. it&#8217;s simple, and bases itself on the premises that change in software specifications is not prohibitive. it seems like a fun methodology to work under, unlike most of those i&#8217;ve seen come and go again.<\/p>\n<p>am i geeking? yes i am!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>well, apart from the fact that signes away for a week, and i miss her, and most of my friends are away on vacation, and i wasted the entire week-end doing zilch in front of the tv, i actually feel ok. i&#8217;m looking forward to 4 weeks in mexico, and maybe just before, or right after that, a big decision for my future&#8230;. shh! it&#8217;s a secret, but it has to do with work.<br \/>\nthe wireless manager for our international office, asked me wether i wanted to go to NY for a few months. and there are a number of other opportunities, that i can&#8217;t really talk about right now, but i assure you, you&#8217;ll be the first to know, as soon as a full public scream is in order. <\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Unfortunately my mailing list broke down, along with most of the other cgi on the site. I replaced the search function with a hosted service from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atomz.com\">atomz.com<\/a>, and that rocks, so i&#8217;m slowly out-sourcing ther functionality on the site. first blogger, then atomz, what will be next? maybe i&#8217;ll move the guestbook somewhere \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>apart from all this i&#8217;m really starving. about time i get dinner \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>also about time i get involved in something else than this stock-market driven reality of work. i miss the discussions on brainstorms, i used to have, and all the idealistic plans of saving the world. i guess sometimes, getting to know yourself better isn&#8217;t always 100% the way to go. i used to really belive in my ability and desire to make a change, but gradually i&#8217;ve come to realize, that i&#8217;m great at getting the ideas, getting all excited about them, talking and dreaming, but when it comes to making a project happen, that&#8217;s just not me!<br \/>\ni&#8217;d really like to volunteer for something like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekcorps.org\/ghana.html\">geek corps.<\/a> they arrange for geeks like me to spend some valuable time helping and training 3rd world technology companies to get on top, and have a shot in an increasingly divided technology world. that, i think is something i could really do. help someone using what i&#8217;m good at, is what i might like to do. and 3 months in africa, is something i think, even i could survive.<\/p>\n<p>remember: always remember who your real friends are \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi there&#8230;.
