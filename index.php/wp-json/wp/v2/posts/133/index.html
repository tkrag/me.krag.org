Combining that with DoCoMo&#8217;s unique position as a majority operator in one of the worlds biggest mobile markets, and the degree of control over handsets that that provides them with, and you have a Japanese market launch where almost every detail of the &#8220;official&#8221; I-mode experience is controlled by the operator. <\/p>\n<p>In brief, I doubt that the European I-mode introduction will have a profound effect on mobile Internet use in Europe, although certain successful applications are sure to show up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>European I-mode launch &#8211; After years of hearing how I-mode, being a much superior technology, would replace WAP in Europe within months, it finally arrives.
