Presenting their new phones a week before CeBit, allegedly to avoid drowning in the plethora of product presentations at that show, the new company is focusing on the technological prowess, as well as available content for their phones.<\/p>\n<p>The top model, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symbian.com\/news\/2002\/soneric-p800-2.html\">P800<\/a> is a smartphone based on the Symbian 7.0 Operating System, and comes equipped with a camera, MMS and GPRS support and is seemingly a direct competitor to Nokia&#8217;s camera-equipped <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/content\/5\/22934.html\">7650<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Also in the new range is the first commercially available Sony Ericsson phone, which is essentially an upgrade of the Ericsson <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sonyericsson.com\/T68\/\">T68<\/a>, named the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hallo.dk\/cfml\/index.cfm?show=mobiltelefoner\/mobiltelefoninfo.cfm&#038;nModelNo=134&#038;CFID=140601&#038;CFTOKEN=26288803\">T68i<\/a>. The T68i is the first phone on the market with support for the new messaging standard MMS (Multimedia Messaging System), which allows SMS like functionality with the addition of images and sound-bites.<\/p>\n<p>The final phone in the new series, is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hallo.dk\/cfml\/index.cfm?show=mobiltelefoner\/mobiltelefoninfo.cfm&#038;nModelNo=135&#038;CFID=140601&#038;CFTOKEN=26288803\">Z700<\/a>, which includes Java-support and comes complete with Java-based games, including games based on the movies &#8220;Men in Black&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie&#8217;s Angels&#8221;. Incidentally both movie&#8217;s owned by Sony. <\/p>\n<p>While the heritage in the T68i is obviously Ericsson&#8217;s earlier phones, the Z700, aimed at the consumer market is clearly derived (in design) from Sony&#8217;s earlier mobile phones, specifically the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hallo.dk\/cfml\/index.cfm?show=mobiltelefoner\/mobiltelefoninfo.cfm&#038;nModelNo=76&#038;CFID=140601&#038;CFTOKEN=26288803\">CMD-Z5<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;m happy to see a few technologically advance, and well-designed mobile-phones from Sony Ericsson. Combining Ericsson&#8217;s technical prowess, with Sony&#8217;s superb understanding of Consumer Electronics should, and will, result in some nice handsets. The question, which will remain unanswered until we have phone&#8217;s in the hands of consumers, is whether this synergy is already visible in their 1st generation handsets.<\/p>\n<div class=\"item\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sony Ericsson Presents New Phones &#8211; Sony Ericsson, the merger of mobile phone departments from Swedish telecom developer Ericsson, and Japanese Consumer Electronics giant Sony, has finally revealed their new line of phones.
