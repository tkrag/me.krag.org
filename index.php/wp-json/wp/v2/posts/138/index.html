Unfortuantely I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try this new gadget, and typing on cloth might take some getting used to, but knowing logitechs eye for quality, I am guessing it makes a nice alternative to the more traditional plastic keyboards.<br \/>\nAnd while on the subject og logitech, they have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.logitech.com\/cf\/about\/pressRelease.cfm\/4412\">announced<\/a> a partnership with Swedish paen-computing company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anoto.com\/\">Anoto<\/a>. This is a boost for what is essentially one of my favourite innovations in the handheld computing arena, the Anoto pen solution. I won&#8217;t go into details of why it&#8217;s such an interesting technology, suffice it to say that their approach is in changing the paper we use, which minimizes the peripherals needed, and the processign power required to convert motion into text (or context).<\/p>\n<div class=\"item\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New handheld keyboards from logitech &#8211; Logitech is showcasing 2 new keyboards for handheld computers at CeBit.
