isn\u2019t it great that"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Hey, isn&#8217;t it great that i&#8217;m back, that this potent stack of diatribes i refer to as my special place on-line, is in fact alive and kicking? ok, it could kick a little more than it does, but then who couldn&#8217;t?<br \/>\ni&#8217;ve been working excessive hours lately, partly because signe has been away for the past week, partly because some people consider 4 weeks of vacation in the internet business, paramount to spending an entire lifetime on the karmic road suspended inanimately on some luxurious beach&#8230;.. some of my colleagues, as well as my own conscience, would think it the only decent thing to do, if i worked my asss of to close whatever cases i have lying around my desk, make sure there are no unpleasant surprises for my clients while i&#8217;m away, and generally work my rear end off, to ensure an eventless leave.<br \/>\ni consider it my basic human right, to disappear for long enough to get the internet, technology, and the unhealthy obsession with e-value out of the systemfor once. and i do belive the most effecient way is to leave for as long a period as i can get away with.<br \/>\ni mean the first 10 days are spent just winding down, readjusting to a pace that&#8217;s slower by a factor 2-300, the next 10 days are filled with excitement, the thrill of a new place, the smell of the tropics, the soul-cleansing of interacting with people who have a much healthier approach to life, and the last 10 days are needed to get that tan, that&#8217;ll make everyone envious. you see, i really need the 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>oh, and while i&#8217;m working on that tan, i&#8217;ll be reading, and it&#8217;ll be a good old-fashioned, tree-killing book, about some obscure world, with obscure inhabitants doing unspeakably obscure acts of good and evil&#8230;. no internet, no programming, no wireless case studies, in fact, nothing that&#8217;ll allow me to keep abreast of developments at home. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll leave that up to an intensive week of 2500 e-mails when I get back&#8230;.. <\/p>\n<p>Mexico it is, and i&#8217;ll be visiting my brother, his wife, and their kids, my two wonderful chocolate-coloured nieces, lisa and amanda&#8230;. and i&#8217;ll be going with signe, whom i really truly do love, and i&#8217;m not quite sure how good it&#8217;ll be, wether excellent, or just beautiful, wether amazing or just incredible, but it&#8217;ll be good that&#8217;s for sure&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>I think maybe it&#8217;ll get me thinking again. so much has changed in the 3 years since i got back from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.krag.org\/Tomas\/Tripping\/index.html\">south america<\/a>. i <a href=\"http:\/\/www.krag.org\/Tomas\/Rant\/98\/ix\/12.html\">stopped<\/a> dreaming as much as i used too, i no longer think fondly every week of all the adventures the world has to offer. i wish, sometimes i&#8217;d do it more, focus less on work and more on those exciting dreams, but that, i guess is the way it is sometimes. when work is exciting and offers plenty opportunities to grow, to learn, to challenge myself, then it becomes engrossing, filling large parts of my life. i guess, and i really hope it&#8217;ll be a periodic thing. so many years of full-on work, excitement, achievements, l\u00e6earning, followed by so many years of challenging that other side of myself, the spiritual, the wandering nomadic soul that lives within, followd again by the physical, the need to go canoeing in the wilderness, to hike for days with only what i can carry on my back. this is something i hope to achieve. the intellectual, the spiritual, the physical, the trinity that makes me tick.<\/p>\n<p>it&#8217;s the intellectual at the moment, the thoughts and mental challenges that drive me, and the spiritual and physical i miss. i miss it sorely, i hope to get some compensation for both in the next 4 weeks, but compensatioin is all it&#8217;ll ever be. <\/p>\n<p>as i said before, maybe one day, i can again have the courage and opportunity to unplog from this intellectual society i live in, and for a while at least, again drift on the zephyr of whim, going from place to place, doing things, seeing things, for no other reason that i can, and i want to. letting, for hours on end, my mind drift into recesses where new truths are spoken, and maybe remebered, where insight is a constant visitor, and instinct a better guide than intellect&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>there is aneed for all these things,<br \/>\nthese realizations that mark reality,<br \/>\nthis reality that is complex, a patchwork of inputs, a golden road between extremes,<br \/>\nnot the life-path of ambition, extreme achievement, success,<br \/>\nnot the life-path of total dedication to mind and emotion,<br \/>\nnot the life-path of the physical, the forceful and the extreme,<\/p>\n<p>i don&#8217;t want success in the eyes of the society i live in,<br \/>\nbecause all too often that success is useless but in that single aperture that is intellect, finance or even the physical,<br \/>\ni don&#8217;t want nirvana in the eyes of religion,<br \/>\nbecause all too often that nirvane, that salvation, is purely emotional, a result of 100% commitment to the creed,<br \/>\ni don&#8217;t want to constantly challenge extremes,<br \/>\nbecause all too often, that challenge is bought at high rates, payed in emotion, love and succes&#8230;.. <\/p>\n<p>let me have a little of each, let me never loose sight of the complexities of life,<br \/>\nof the nomads heart beneath the businessmans head,<br \/>\nof the scholars mind above the enduring body,<br \/>\nof the child within, in the glow of the loving soul<\/p>\n<p>Bye again
