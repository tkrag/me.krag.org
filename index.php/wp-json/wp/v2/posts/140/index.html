My home set-up now consists of a ADSL connection I share with my neighbour, a linux server and gateway (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.e-smith.org\/\">The Open-Source version of Mitel Networks e-smith<\/a>) and a<a href=\"http:\/\/www.linksys.com\/Products\/product.asp?prid=157&#038;grid=22\"> LinkSys WAP11 AP<\/a> with which I connect my laptop to the network.<br \/>\nAll this experimentation will eventually lead to a full-length article here on Wireless New&#8217;s about wireless home networks. Focusing on a comparison of Linux and Windows XP as clients, as well as a look at different network sniffers.<br \/>\nI hope it ends up being worth the wait&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scandinavian telecom news<\/strong><br \/>\nA few highly interesting developments on the Scandinavian telecom market.<br \/>\nMost importantly, the awaited merger of Sonera and Telia, into what is by far Scandinavia&#8217;s largest Operator. With combined 2001 revenue of around 9 billion Euro&#8217;s and 34.000 employees, this new construction out-dwarfs the other large Scandinavian Players.<br \/>\nWith a home market that covers all of Scandinavia as well as the Baltic Nations the new operator has European scale. However there are some questions surrounding this merger. With both the Stockholm and the Helsinki Stock Exchanges reacting negatively, and with Sonera not quite out of the crisis that has been draining their resources for the past year or so, the new giant has a long way to go to prove it&#8217;s worth.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, with Sonera known for numerous innovations in the mobile market, and with Telia fairly aggressive in the 802.11b market (with their HomeRun service) their is basis for some interesting innovations there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TeleDanmark to move on iMode<\/strong><br \/>\nAnd apparently Denmarks largest operator, Tele Danmark, believes fervently in the iMode concept. They are working on a similar system, with similar revenue share models, to be launched on GPRS phones in the near future. This is somewhat rich from a company that is known today for it&#8217;s completely unreasonable revenue share&#8217;s on current premium-rate SMS services, as well as it&#8217;s many problems with handling even simple content-based pricing models. We&#8217;ll see, but my vote on this is that they&#8217;re attempting to surf the hype of the recent iMode launch in Germany.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let me begin by explaining the last weeks absence from this news site.
