Along with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sputnik.com\/\">Sputnik<\/a> and Joltage<a href=\"http:\/\/www.joltage.com\/\"><\/a>, Deep Blue is offering it&#8217;s centralized billing and authentication software to people interested in setting up WiFi Hotspots. The business model is based on revenue sharing. I set up a Hotspot using Deep Blue software, and anyone with a Deep Blue account can log-on and pay for wireless access using any Deep Blue Hotspot. My win: A piece of the revenue generated by my Hotspot, which incidentally is owned and paid for by me. The main difference between the 3 companies, apart from what regions they focus on, is the status of the actual software and authentication solution. Sputnik sticks it&#8217;s head out of the crowd by using an Open-Source software solution, based on NoCatAuth, an Authentication solution developed by a Sonoma County, California, wireless community network called <a href=\"http:\/\/nocat.net\/\">NoCat<\/a>.<br \/>\nThe question of course remains whether this is a viable business model. However, the technology is cheap and fairly well-known, and there is in fact little reason why someone with a HotSpot in a public placed shouldn&#8217;t sign up for such a service. After all, software such as Sputnik&#8217;s still guarantees the network owner, priority access, so in essence here&#8217;s an option to make some potential revenue out of your excess bandwidth. <\/p>\n<p>Most importantly it seems that WiFi has reached a sort of critical mass in the US, in which more new WiFi companies pop up every week. The question remains if Europe is going to follow, and when.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the recent addition of Deep Blue Wireless, to the ranks of US companies trying their hand at provisioning WiFi networks, this business model is really about to get tested.
