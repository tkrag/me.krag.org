Giant pyramids to the Sun and Moon, we hiked up them, sat down for a view of the ancient pre-hispanic city of Teotihuacan. That was yesterday&#8230;. Today, 500 Km&#8217;s south-west, after a 6 hour night-time bus journey, we&#8217;re sitting in an internet cafe, overlooking the cathedral of this charming colonial city&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>With roots back to an old indian settlement, Oaxaca is an interesting mix of indian, spanish colonial and modern influence, but more importantly it&#8217;s our first backpacking step on this trip.

For the first day of real backpacking, I have to admit, I&#8217;m nervous, worried about how we will get on, distrustful of the locals (just to a slight degree) and generally a little too used to the comfort of security and knowledge&#8230; I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll pass in the next few days, once i get used to the modus vivendi again&#8230;. <\/p>\n<p>in the meantime, i&#8217;ll try and keep you all updated&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow is ruin time again, when we seek out the Zapotec city at Monte Alban for a day trip, before we spend another night on a bus, this time the 9 hour trip to Pochutla, from where we will go directly to Puerto Angel, Coffee Port, and quiet beach resort on the pacific, after all, what would a vacation in Mexico be, without trying the waters of the Pacific as well as the Carribean \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Cheers and Hasta La Vista<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oaxaca, Mexico!
