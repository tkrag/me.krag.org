It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve spent a part of my recent vacation (Vienna, Slovakia, Prague) thinking about, so it prompted a bit of a word flood.<br \/>\nAnd since this is the first time I&#8217;ve written anything fairly coherent about the subject, I figured i&#8217;d pop it into multiplicity for laughs, so here goes:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<\/p>\n[&#8230;] in general making this change in my life is the best thing I have done in my professional career. Last week (somewhere in Slovakia) I was eating an icecream, thinking about why I do what I do (I started thinking about the luxury of actually being able to buy an ice cream when you feel like it), and especially why i do it. I think it comes down to not buying into 2 of the commonly heard statements\/excuses for our western lifestyle and excesses:<\/p>\n<p>Some people say: &#8220;I worked hard to get where I got, and I deserve to enjoy the benefits&#8221;, I don&#8217;t believe a word of it. I never really worked that hard, never really suffered the uncertainty of not knowing where my next meal should come from, and never really needed to worry about getting a job. What&#8217;s more, at the moment I am living a very nice and comfortable life only getting paid 2 days a week, and still not sorely lacking any luxury. At the same time I have met litterally hundreds of people who have worked harder than me, at every step of my life, but ended up with decidedly less. It&#8217;s not so much that I&#8217;ve earned it, but that I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to have been handed the opportunities and smart enough to grab them when offered.<\/p>\n<p>Some people add to that: &#8220;It really won&#8217;t make a difference whether I part with a little of what I have, not in the large scheme of things at least.&#8221; Well, I stopped believing in the large scheme of things. It&#8217;s a useless abstraction, because to me as an individual there is no large scheme of things, and if there was, I should probably just stop eating, breathing and living, it wouldn&#8217;t make a difference either way. There really is only the small perspective, the one in which I, by definition, can make a difference. And making a difference is not only very possible, (I learnt that in my 3 months as a volunteer in Ghana, and in my earlier days backpacking South America), it doesn&#8217;t even have to difficult, disrupting or painful. <\/p>\n<p>The conclusion to this is not that I need to become a pauper, giving away every last thing I have, but that I feel a need to take into consideration the perspective of other people than myself when I choose what to do and work with. It&#8217;s difficult, sometimes to justify ever doing something selfish such as spending my money on a vacation and ice cream, but luckily I&#8217;m post-modern enough not to have to follow my essential beliefs to their extreme conclusions \ud83d\ude42 <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if any of this makes sense, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve managed to explain to myself the reason for doing what I am.<\/p>\n<p>The more practical background is different, and concerns itself with that nagging feeling that what I was doing in the Internet industry, while challenging, succesful and interesting, wasn&#8217;t really &#8220;enough&#8221; in that metaphysical kind of way. First I went off backpacking, back in 1997, looking for different perspectives on life, and while the immediateness of that life appealed to me I couldn&#8217;t really see myself in that kind of nomadic life. Frankly the fear of losing touch with friends, family and anything else remotely permanent was quitely nagging. So I went to work in a series of interesting, well-paying, jobs where I both learnt a lot and had a large degree of freedom, but could never shake the feeling that there was little value in being part of the make-the-rich-richer-while-pleasing-the-investor approach. I finally decided I didn&#8217;t entirely fit in when I realized I was one of the only people in a 130 person web-company who didn&#8217;t belive the hype enough to buy stock in the company I worked in, even though we were succesful enough in that dot-com kind of way.<br \/>\nAt the same time, I kept looking for worth-while projects, especially in the developing world and technology sphere, to do in my spare time. But projects were rare, and my spare time rarer yet.<\/p>\n<p>So when the company I worked for started consolidating, and I was pointed by my brother to a slashdot posting about <a href\n=\"http:\/\/www.geekcorps.org\/\">GeekCorps<\/a> (some time in May 2000), it took me all of 20 minutes to decide I would apply for a volunteer position with their first group going to Ghana, and that evening I calmly told my girlfriend that I was hoping to go to Africa for a while to pursue my dreams. I settled back into work and heard nothing for 4 or 5 months (while the first group of geeks was sent to Ghana by geekcorps), until one day I got an e-mail from North Adams, Mass., asking me whether I was still interested. A quick yes, a phone interview and a stack of e-mails later, I was making appointments for various innoculations, and trying to get rid of my apartment. <\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say much here and now about my 3 and a half months in Ghana and North Adams, most of that is covered at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekhalla.org\/\">geekhalla<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekcorps.org\/\">GeekCorps<\/a> as well as at my <a href=\"http:\/\/krag.org\/\">old blog<\/a>, except to say that ultimately what I got out of it was faith. A belief that working with the digital divide was not just a silent dream of mine, but was actually possible in real-life, that people where interested and that it *probably* could make a real difference.<\/p>\n<p>Since I returned from Ghana into the midst of a dot-com crisis, I did some (but not enough) traditional consulting, but kept my ears and eyes open for possibilites in the digital divide area. And so I find myself today working with a few projects in the area (most importantly <a href=\"http:\/\/wire.less.dk\/\">wire.less.dk<\/a>, as well as seriously considering going back to get a master&#8217;s degree in this area (that is if I can find a university that is interested in the area, and will have me as a student :-).<\/p>\n<p>Why wireless? Well, it&#8217;s what I worked with in Ghana, due mostly to a confusion between my mobile Internet expertise (WAP\/GPRS\/SMS etc.) and the wireless Internet (802.11b) expertise wanted by my partner company. But more imprtantly the political and democratic perspectives of community owned, low-cost wireless networks are obvious, oh and it&#8217;s a lot of fun too.<br \/>\n&#8211; &#8211; &#8211;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Howard Rheingold sent me an e-mail with a fairly innocuous question about my peronal reason for leaving a &#8216;normal&#8217; job to work with Digital Divide issues and wire.less.dk.
