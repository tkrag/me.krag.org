The first 3G handset from industry leader Nokia Corp. is set to be announced Sept. 26, though large volumes won&#8217;t be available until 2003. The region&#8217;s operators will order roughly $1.5 billion in 3G equipment this year and $5.5 billion next year, figures brokerage WestLB Panmure. Network construction is well under way, albeit at a slower pace than earlier predicted; in Spain, for instance, Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles has already installed 750 Ericsson 3G base stations in 21 cities for a likely commercial kickoff next year. Test networks are running in two dozen European countries, and by the end of this year, commercial 3G services should be launched in Britain, Finland, and Italy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of whether 3G will happen,&#8221; says analyst Per Lindberg of brokerage Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. &#8220;It&#8217;s already here.&#8221;&#8221;\n<\/p>\n<p>Article:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/magazine\/content\/02_35\/b3797133.htm\">BW Online | September 2, 2002 | Commentary: There&#8217;s Plenty of Life Left in 3G Wireless<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here&#8217;s another positive look at 3G in Europe.
