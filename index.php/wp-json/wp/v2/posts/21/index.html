welcome new times, although i still, as always, have my doubts about what i want to be doing, where i want to do it, and how much i can afford to let it mean to me. the zeitgeist speaks of identification through work, of the luxury of having a job you love, of really feeling the possibilities for growth, of commiting yourself 100% to the job at hand. the zeitgeist conveniently forgets to mention that there are other things in life that could be getting that same attention. although i must adm,it that i am fairly sceptical of the, at times, prevalent attitude that i&#8217;m spending too much time at work, stressing myself too much, giving too much of myself. it just so happens that i enjoy it, get a lot of intellectual challenges, and a lot of very interesting human interaction at that place called work. some people fill their time besides work with a sport, with the challenge of competition, physical strains and drive. i fill the time at work with the challenge of competition, intellectual strain and drive&#8230;. how one is better than the other is beyond me, but then i&#8217;ve never seen the whole picture, or at least not the same whole picture as so many other people seem to see&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>at least, even though i&#8217;m dead tired now, from working most of last night, i can take the evening, visit my parents, and feel good about a job well done. and although it&#8217;s far from perfect and you may see me leaving to pursue other things at some point, i doubt very much that i&#8217;ll be running away screaming. on the contrary, i&#8217;ll probably be slipping away, wondering every step of the way wether it was the right decision, and repeatedly telling myself why it was, and how great things will be afterwards&#8230;..<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OK, people have told me that my current output in terms of sheer &#8220;useless comments per time-unit&#8221;
