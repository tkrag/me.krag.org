This time as an illustration for Sundays African Cup qualifyer with Burundi. A year and a half out of the country they still find it hillarious, the picture of the sweating obruni in the Ghana outfit. So do I&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>The second item is explained here (from an e-mail i sent back to geekcorps HQ):<\/p>\n<p>I just had an interesting experience here in Yerevan. For whatever reason<br \/>\ntonight is party\/night in Yerevan. A large stage has been erected on<br \/>\nRepublic Square right in front of Hotel Armenia. So I went to have a look,<br \/>\nand there, on the square, what do I see?<\/p>\n<p>I was hungry, but not really wanting to sit down at some restaurant, so i<br \/>\nlooked around for a food stall. there, right on republic square is a truck<br \/>\nthat apparently sells food, so I go closer to see what they have on offer.<br \/>\nThe logos seem familiar, but from the distance I can&#8217;t really make out the<br \/>\ndetails. until i get close enough. There&#8217;s a yellow and red logo of a<br \/>\nsteamboat on white background. Can it be? A image of Ring road pops into<br \/>\nmy head, and many a night spent eating pizza, fried chicken or the like.<br \/>\nAt first i think it&#8217;s a coincidence, but the closer i get the more sure I<br \/>\nam. It IS Southern Fried Chicken, right there in Yerevan on Republic<br \/>\nSquare. The same logo. The same motto, expounding the glories of<br \/>\n&#8220;Sizzling&#8221; southern fried chicken.<\/p>\n<p>And just a few hours before I was talking to Arman and a few IESC<br \/>\nvolunteers, trying to explain just how huge the difference between Yerevan<br \/>\nand Accra is. But it&#8217;s not that big, apparently \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Oh, well that was anecdote of the day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here i am at an internet cafe in yerevan. no pictures yet, as that requires one of two things: That I sucessfully get my laptop on-line, or that I get my camera connected to a computer at one of these internet cafes. i&#8217;m working on the first option, while option 2 is emergency plan B [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[16,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>more yerevan &bull; krag.be<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2002\/10\/12\/more-yerevan\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"more yerevan &bull; krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Here i am at an internet cafe in yerevan. no pictures yet, as that requires one of two things: That I sucessfully get my laptop on-line, or that I get my camera connected to a computer at one of these internet cafes. i&#8217;m working on the first option, while option 2 is emergency plan B [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2002\/10\/12\/more-yerevan\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2002-10-12T08:42:28+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Tomas\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"2 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/\",\"name\":\"krag.be\",\"description\":\"I am multiple and various - Tomas A.
