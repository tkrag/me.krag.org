flowing from the fact that i know i am here doing something i am good at, having fun, learning new things every day, and at least trying to make a difference in a fragmented world.<\/p>\n<p>solitude &#8211; both in a positive and negative sense. even with lots of newfound friends around me, i inevitably miss my wonderful family, especially signe, my friends and my well-known, well-worn day-to-day life. and while i am one to enjoy the thoughtful, meditative powers of solitude, i am also as much a social being as most others. from time to time, it&#8217;s difficult to think about the distances, mental more than physical, between the role i have chosen for myself here, and the daily universe i call my own back in denmark.<\/p>\n<p>frustration\/depression &#8211; mostly at the world, politics, terrorism, and probably to an even greater extent the widely accepted state terrorism that seems to be eternally covered up by a complacent media, strong political administrations, and the need for people to belive in good and evil. it saddens my heart that the world is becoming ever more fragmented, prospects for peace ever more ethereal for every time someone uses the word war, wether on terrorism, against terrorism, or in any other perspective.<\/p>\n<p>luckily however, the first of the emotions is strongest, easiest to relate to, and generally the last one on my mind before i fall asleep in that godawful 190 cm bed&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>i had no idea internet would be this difficult. i was so close to getting my own dial-up account from local isp netsys, when the telephone monopoly decided to shut of their phone lines for no apparent reason. so here i am, in armenia, laptop loaded with connection possibilities, and no way to get it [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[16,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>almost 3 weeks in &bull;
