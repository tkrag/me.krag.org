most likely they&#8217;ll just glide back out of my circle of acquaintances. we might keep in contact for a while. i even hope i&#8217;ll be back for a short-term stay some time soonish. but most likely they will slowly slip out of my acquaintance. not forgotten, but no longer an integral part of who i am. it&#8217;s kind of sad. mostly because it&#8217;s such a certainty, and because there just might, conceivably be someone in that group of people that would make my life richer for having them as a friend.<br \/>\nin a way it goes with the territory. with travelling in this way. with being such a restless person. constantly looking for that thing in life that makes a difference.<br \/>\nand i don&#8217;t regret it. not like that. i just makes me wonder. wonder what all these short-term relationships, passing acquaintances, new impressions, add up to. what they all mean, and how profoundly, or superficially they will end up influencing my life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>it&#8217;s a all a little bit strange. going home! after just 30 days here in armenia, i&#8217;ve started thinking about going home. i&#8217;m ready to go home. i&#8217;ve had a great time here, i love the work i do on a trip like this. i love meeting new people, seeing new places, trying on new [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[16,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>meeting people &bull; krag.be<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2002\/11\/02\/meeting-people\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"meeting people &bull; krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"it&#8217;s a all a little bit strange. going home! after just 30 days here in armenia, i&#8217;ve started thinking about going home. i&#8217;m ready to go home. i&#8217;ve had a great time here, i love the work i do on a trip like this. i love meeting new people, seeing new places, trying on new [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2002\/11\/02\/meeting-people\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2002-11-02T17:18:57+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Tomas\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"3 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/\",\"name\":\"krag.be\",\"description\":\"I am multiple and various - Tomas A.
