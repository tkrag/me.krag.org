and opportunity has knocked. while i was dreaming up ways of staying in the business, i was lucky enough that someone else agreed with me on the valkue of doing something. some time early last year, came probably the most significant act of the last few years of my life. i faded out a consultancy gig, and joined my friend and colleague <a href=\"http:\/\/less.dk\">sebastian<\/a> in starting <a href=\"http:\/\/wire.less.dk\">wire.less.dk<\/a>.<br \/>\ni won&#8217;t get too deep into our comings and goings with wire.less.dk here. suffice it to say that we both belive in not only the possibility, but also the necessity, of distributed, locally owned networks, and that low-cost wireless technologies lend themselves admirably to that kind of application. and finally that everyone in the world has a right, and a need to be part of the internet, to have access to information, education and enlightenment, as well as the global markets.<br \/>\nthat&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working for, and as so many people have said before. having to make do with less money, and fewer material pleasures is a small price to pay for living what you believe.<br \/>\nIf you have a hard time grasping that fact, or just want to a second opinion, read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/online\/66\/mylife.html\">this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;The ruling assumption is that money is the shortest route to freedom. Absurdly, that strategy is cast as the &#8220;practical approach.&#8221; But in truth, the opposite is true. The shortest route to the good life involves building the con&#64257;dence that you can live happily within your means ( whatever the means provided by the choices that are truly acceptable to you turn out to be ). It&#8217;s scary to imagine living on less. But embracing your dreams is surprisingly liberating. Instilled with a sense of purpose, your spending habits naturally reorganize, because you discover that you need less.&#8221;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>wish us luck.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;speak friend, and enter!&#8221; &#8211; The door of the mines of Moria, LOTR, The fellowship of the Ring a new year has begun, an old one passed away. i thoight i&#8217;d try and write a small status of my life, my interests, and dreams. for those that know me well, not much has changed. for [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[9,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>it\u2019s a new year &bull; krag.be<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2003\/01\/02\/its-a-new-year\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"it\u2019s a new year &bull; krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"&#8220;speak friend, and enter!&#8221; &#8211; The door of the mines of Moria, LOTR, The fellowship of the Ring a new year has begun, an old one passed away. i thoight i&#8217;d try and write a small status of my life, my interests, and dreams. for those that know me well, not much has changed. for [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2003\/01\/02\/its-a-new-year\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2003-01-02T07:26:54+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Tomas\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"5 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/\",\"name\":\"krag.be\",\"description\":\"I am multiple and various - Tomas A.
