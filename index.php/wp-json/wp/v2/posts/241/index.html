Mostly because people, of course, are busy, but also just for lack of a common theme or goal to bring us together. <\/p>\n<p>But yesterday I had the good fortune to participate in part of a class at Harvard Law School, taught by a range of the fellows at the Berkman Center, including my good friend (and hero?) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekcorps.org\/default.asp?l1i=1&#038;l2i=4&#038;l3i=14#14\">Ethan<\/a>, who&#8217;s just been given a spot as a Fellow.<br \/>\nIt was an interesting class, and I recommend anyone who&#8217;s interested in ICT for Development to have a look at the class material, <a href=\"http:\/\/cyber.law.harvard.edu\/is03\/syllabus.htm#12\">here<\/a> (it&#8217;s class 12, if anyone should be in doubt).<\/p>\n<p>I also had a good meeting with <a href=\"http:\/\/web.media.mit.edu\/~mikeb\/\">Mike Best<\/a> @ the MEdia Lab, and it was definitely one of the more fruitful talks I had, mostly because his work in wireless is very close to my own, so we got into some level of tech detail.<\/p>\n<p>The only people I haven&#8217;t been able to corner in my week in Cambridge, were David Reed and Sandy Pentland, so all in all it&#8217;s been a success. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s gotten me any closer to understanding whether the Media Lab is the right place for the type of research I want to do, but it&#8217;s  definitely worth thinking about if they&#8217;ll have me.<\/p>\n<p>I knwo for sure that Cambridge is an amazing place in that respect. The world center of ICT for development research, and a nice place to boot. With so many institutions doing work in this area, at Harvard and MIT, it would be a grewat place for me to go and just learn more. Just some of the institutions doing stuff in this area include Harvard Law School, The Berkman Center for Internet &#038; Society @ Harvard, Harvard Business School, The Medialab @ MIT, The Sloan School for Management @ MIT, The Kennedy School for Government (and the Center for International Development) @ Harvard, etc.<\/p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;ve made up my mind on 2 things. I want a master&#8217;s degree, in some form of ICT and Development, and I&#8217;d love for it to be done in Cambridge. <\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Internet &#038; Society: The Technologies and Politics of Control\" href=\"http:\/\/cyber.law.harvard.edu\/is03\/syllabus.htm#12\">Internet &#038; Society: The Technologies and Politics of Control<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday was one of the better days of my time here in Boston.
