Namely that the goal of &#8220;Universal Access&#8221; which has been touted broadly in development circles, is not only naive in the extreme, but is also counter-productive. It sets impossible goals, and takes focus away from real problems with real solutions. <\/p>\n<p>A village that get&#8217;s screwed by middle-men when selling their crop is a real problem, and a communication system that gives them access to market information is a real solution. <\/p>\n<p>The lack of access to good tertiary education in Africa is a real problem, and an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avu.org\/\">African Virtual University<\/a> is one possible answer.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, the fact that not everyone in the world has Internet access is not a real problem. It may be a symptom of some larger problem, but in and of itself it is not the issue.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never liked the term &#8220;Digital Divide&#8221;, but even more importantly, i&#8217;ve never liked the tendency to focus always on the &#8220;Big Picture&#8221;. <\/p>\n<p>Peter Thomas, is of course correct in his analysis that getting Internet access to everyone in the world is a hopeless goal, unrealistic and not even necessarily desirable. Looking at the world as a massive unit is bound to be a problem. I&#8217;m interested in specific projects. In individual cases in which there is a need for ICT&#8217;s on the ground, and in which I can provide a better solution than most other people.<\/p>\n<p>In that single situation where I can help provide a cheaper, better connectivity solution than might be available in the local market. In that one situation I might be able to save a bit of money in a specific project. Money that can then be put towards educating the users, or improving the local language applications. It may be a stretch, but not nearly as much as the whole &#8220;Universal Access&#8221; shindig.<\/p>\n<p>To paraphrase a scene from &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Boy: Do not try and mend the Big Picture. That&#8217;s impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth.<br \/>\nNeo: What truth?<br \/>\nBoy: There is no Big Picture.<br \/>\nNeo: There is no Big Picture?<br \/>\nBoy: Then you&#8217;ll see that it is not the Big Picture that mends, it is only yourself.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This entry over at the Riptari Filter: Riptari Filter: The Search for life on Mars Makes some interesting points, comparing &#8220;bridging the digital divide&#8221; with &#8220;Searching for life on Mars&#8221;.
