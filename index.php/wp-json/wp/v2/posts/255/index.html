A good question to ask, then, is how do we promote real survival in the market without refuting the possibility in our initial attempts? More to the point, there is a lot of talk about how important &#8220;access to information&#8221; is, how information leads to a number of great things and empowering possibilities. Glocal recently linked to a book by Dr. Kingo Mchombu that appears to assume information as the key to a healthy modern community. But if the only sustainable source of all this great information is always a generous aid project, what is the point of providing it? Asked another way and referencing ICT Update once again, what is the real benefit of a government removing &#8220;price controls and legal restrictions on private sector involvement&#8221; if USAID has to be involved?<\/p>\n<p>The attempts to apply the internet&#8217;s benefits worldwide likely require a different mindset entirely, and before real progress starts we have to begin constructing it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>OK, I buy the existence of this basic paradox. It&#8217;s a real problem, and one of the reasons <a href=\"http:\/\/wire.less.dk\">we<\/a> have this hybrid non-profit\/commercial business model in mind. A slightly absurd hybrid business model to deal with a real life dilemna. <\/p>\n<p>I also buy the part about the different mindset, and I honestly think that that&#8217;s where people with a commercial background, and a healthy dose of scepticism towards development in general, come in to the picture. That mindset has to grow from honest dialogue between those who know about solutions, and those who have problems that need solving. <\/p>\n<p>The fact that I am really doing what I&#8217;m doing, not out of altruism, but simply because it&#8217;s a bundle of fun, and makes me feel really good about myself (at least sometimes), is probably significant. The fact that I know can&#8217;t even begin to do this without a whole lot of help from people on the ground who understand the issues and problems might help as well. <\/p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t change the basic point behind Peter Thomas&#8217; issue, namely that this whole idea is ludicrously difficult to implement, if you want to do it right. And that it&#8217;s all a learning process in which we have to be as open as possible to new ideas, and try and learn as much as possible about the domain.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wow, these last days, there&#8217;s been quite some trackback activity between this blog, and Peter Thomas&#8217; riptari filter. i&#8217;m tying to absorb his pov as fast as possible. he just commented on a recent post of mine.
