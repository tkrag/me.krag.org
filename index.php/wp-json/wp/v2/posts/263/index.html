And while I&#8217;m not necessarily a fan of the concept &#8220;Universal Access&#8221;, since it&#8217;s too big, too glamorous, and way too large a goal, David Brake has a valid point. There is nothing inherently wrong with the objective, and the cost\/benefit that Kenny makes is faulty already with todays technology, and will rapidly become further from the truth as technology advances. <\/p>\n<p>My issue with &#8220;Universal Access&#8221; indeed, is not with the cost\/benefit, as much as with a general tendency to want to focus on individual, smaller projects rather thabn large global goals. I have the same problem with the Kyoto Accords, or anything else that claims to be able to get a global, coordinated action in place. <\/p>\n<p>My place, and idealism is in individual, smaller scale projects, where I can actually see the difference it makes within my lifetime.
