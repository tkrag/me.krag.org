Those that create real value to society.<br \/>\nI recently saw a piece on some blog somewhere talking about how there were simply too many lawyers and accountants in the u.s. and europe compared to the higher efficiency societies in south-east asia. how lawyers and accountants essentially add no value, but just spend their time thinking about how to divide up the value there already is. <\/p>\n<p>I dig that!<br \/>\nI&#8217;d even extend that to saying that a lot of the Internet business was (during the boom) just another way to make the same value a different colour.<br \/>\nThe stock market, doesn&#8217;t create value. it redistributes value. and in most cases it does it all wrong. Accountants, Management consultants, lawyers (with a number of notable exceptions), redistribute value.<\/p>\n<p>So i&#8217;ll add to that. There is a fundamentally flawed distribution of value and wealth in the world today. So redistributing value is not necessarily a bad thing. it makes sense. That is, if you&#8217;re redistributing it to right a wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I want to create value, or at the very least give a hand in redistributing it in a fairer manner. I happen to be at my best when working with technology, especially internet communications technology, so i really don&#8217;t want to be a farmer or craftsman (in the traditional sense of the word), because every plant i&#8217;ve ever had to care for has died, and every piece of clay i touched in school turned into some horrible fantasmorgasmic trash. <\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve taken a middle road. Stayed with IT, but tried to apply myself to the redistribution problem. Or maybe even creating. I&#8217;m not sure, but maybe it&#8217;ll dawn on me at some point.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As some of you know, I spend quite some time thinking about why.
