Part of that is that I know I want to work with these issues for the foreseeable future, but I can&#8217;t be sure that wire.less.dk will be able to fund that in the long-term. Part of it is a growing desire to have the time and place to contemplate, and really think about these issues. I know they&#8217;re important, to the woreld, but mostly to me as an individual, and I have a lot of opinions about them.However most of these opinions aren&#8217;t founded in anything I would characterize as a broad understanding of the issues involved.<\/p>\n<p>It would be really great to be accepted at the Media Lab, but who knows.<br \/>\nI&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll get in, and I&#8217;m not sure I can really fund a 2-year master program anywhere else. But that shouldn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t do this deep calm contemplation, should it? After all, since last May I&#8217;ve pretty much been funding my own project (wire.less.dk) from savings and a few family contributions, with a little additional money from a few minor consulting gigs. Well, if I&#8217;m funding myself, shouldn&#8217;t I be able to do exactly what I want? Even if that involves taking 6-8 weeks off to think and write about these issues that interest me so much?<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the intricacies of the current Universal Access debate. Understanding the different POV&#8217;s on Open Source in the developing world.<br \/>\nUnderstanding how low-cost, decentralized (wireless?) networks are significant in this context?<br \/>\nFinding out what projects exist in this area, and wat the experiences from them are? <\/p>\n<p>So what if I could take the time off, maybe get enough funding to travel and meet some of these projects and people, get support and advice from others working in this area, and finally come up with an article\/report\/overview of the state of the debate anno 2003. Who thinks what, who says what and who does what. A 20-page primer basically concerned with the issues I&#8217;ve already touched on in my FAQ on ICTfor Development?<\/p>\n<p>What if worst comes to wors, and it just becomes a wiki skeleton with links and summaries of relevant material, articles and discussions? might that still be worth it?<\/p>\n<p>And would the community in general support me by sending links, comments, peer reviews and good ideas?<\/p>\n<p>Let me know what you think about this idea? should I take 6 weeks off over summer to do something like this? Anyone interested in helping? Anyone have ideas on how I could fund such a thing (small-small)? Even better, anyone know if this sort of primer exists already, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to go to all that trouble?<\/p>\n<p>Let me know what you think, post your comments here, send me <a href=\"mailto:tkrag@multiplicity.dk\">e-mail<\/a>, TrackBack, whatever.<br \/>\nI think I&#8217;d be willing to let &#8220;the community&#8221; at large heavily infuence my decision. If there&#8217;s a general consensus that this would be valuable work in the ICT for Development area, I&#8217;d probably be much more inclined to do it, so the more people that give me an honest opinion on this, the more likely it&#8217;ll get&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I got a crazy idea today.
