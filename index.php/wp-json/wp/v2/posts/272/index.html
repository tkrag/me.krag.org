Cost comparison<br \/>\nThe article states (correctly) that users of telecenters have an inherent disadvantage to those users of the Internet who have home or office access. While that statement is correct, it is an unfair comparison, because the conclusion would have to follow that users of community radio have a disadvantage compared to users of the Internet (even telecenter users) IMO<\/p>\n<p>2. Impact on jobs<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Computers enforce the automation paradigm, which displaces labor with machines. New ICT-based jobs may be created, which may tend to pay higher especially in foreign firms, encouraging a shift to jobs in the ICT sector<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That is an oversimplification of the facts. There is very little indication that the Internet causes job-loss, and there are few real ties between the technologies that actualkly enforce automation (robotics etc.) and communication technologies. <\/p>\n<p>Also claiming that job-creatin caused by the Internet is limited to ICT-related jobs is another oversimplification. There is evidence, perhaps anecdotal, that other sectors can gain a lot from access to information technologies. Projects in India have increased fishing output by leveraging satellite pictures to point fishermen to shoals of fish etc.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost as if this oint is luddite, ie. if we don&#8217;t get technology we won&#8217;t get automation, and hence won&#8217;t lose jobs. A better perspective would be that the advantages of 2-way communication via the internet is better skilled labour, improved democratic influence, and a broader perspective on life in general.<\/p>\n<p>I could probably go on in this vein, but the basic point is that the two technolgies, while serving some of the same information needs are completely different concepts. There is a need for more community radio in many areas, but that doesn&#8217;t negate the need for Internet access in certain contexts.<\/p>\n<p>I acknowledge the fact that the Internet as a communication technology has probebly gotten a little too much attention from donor organisations, international bodies and ngo&#8217;s, at the expense of other technologogies such as commnunity radio. <\/p>\n<p>But some of the comments in the article, such as:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p> The Internet: The next major advance will probably be virtual reality \u2013 3-D, tactile suits and other reality-enhancing developments. This development will probably worsen the negative elements we have identified about the Internet.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>are frankly absurd, and shouldn&#8217;t be brought into such an analysis at all.<\/p>\n<p>It is also worth taking into consideration the fact that for commnuity radio to fullfill a educational and communication need, it is imperative that the broadcasters have access to up-to-date, relevant information, so a solution to this conundrum may be to deliver Internet access to the community radio stations, maybe in connection with a public telecenter, thereby increasing the quality of information relayed through the radio.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Riptari refers to an article by Roberto Verzola, with a comparison of the cost benefit of community radio vs. internet access for the poor.
