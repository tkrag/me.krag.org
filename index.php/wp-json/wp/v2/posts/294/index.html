My argument was mostly about the complexity and additional cost for handsets, and VoIP gateways etc.<\/p>\n<p>But according to <a title=\"Newsfactor: Firms Voice WLAN Doubts\" href=http:\/\/www.newsfactor.com\/perl\/story\/20718.html\">this<\/a> article over at Newsfactor [via <a title=\"Kevin Werbach's Werblog\" href=\"http:\/\/werbach.com\/blog\/2003\/02\/11.html\">Werblog<\/a>], there are concerns that 802.11b just isn&#8217;t stable enough for real-world applications of VoIP.<\/p>\n<p>I disagree, but while I&#8217;ve tried to do single VoIP sessions as well as stream video over a 802.11b link, I have no real good technical counter-arguments to the basic concerns of the article. <\/p>\n<p>It all depends on what requirements you have for QoS, and how you design the specific system&#8230;<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nIt seems that the only point this article even attempts to make concerns the lack of QoS in the current 802.11 standards. I would reply to that, that it is possible to guarantee a certain service effectively simply through design, ie. limiting the number of users on the system, ensuring separate AP&#8217;s (cheap) for VoIP services etc.<\/p>\n<p>Also IEE is working on QoS systems to add to 802.11 standards, although I have no idea whether that will ever happen. <\/p>\n<p>It is important also to recognize that the potential cost-savings offered by a correctly implemented VoIP system may be so significant that users, especially large organisations, might be willing to forego some stability and quality.<\/p>\n<p>The greatest inhibitor is still lack of cheap and easy to set-up equipment more than any inherent shortcoming in the technology.<\/p>\n<p>IMHO of course&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week I posted, regarding the readiness of current WiFi technologies to deliever low-cost VoIP.
