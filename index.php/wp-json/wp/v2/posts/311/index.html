Or at the very least that the role i am playing is insignificant. <\/p>\n<p>and on days like these, i sometiumes dream of the challenges of a dynamic workplace. having clear goals, and a clear path to reach these goals. something slightly less lofty than spending your savings trying to make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>on those days i miss a workplace with colleagues, daily tasks and a direct reliance and appreciation of what i do.  <\/p>\n<p>This is one of those days, and it leaves me mentally exhausted with little energy to do what has to be done, and very little faith in myself, the future of the internet or this business for that matter. <\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, there have been, and will be, so many days where i&#8217;m proud and happy that i am at least wrestling with that dream.
