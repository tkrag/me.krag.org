Microfinance is one of those development efforts that everyone seems to agree, are really important, effective and actually work (which is not the case for most development projects IMHO).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been talking to people like Ethan Zuckerman of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekcorps.org\">GeekCorps<\/a> about the potential of developing good, Opensource-based microfinance software, ever since having a meeting with a small microfinance company during my <a href=\"http:\/\/multiplicity.dk\/archives\/cat_armenia.html\">trip to Armenia<\/a> last october. <\/p>\n<p>One of Ethan&#8217;s ideas is to come up with solid, Open Source software solutions to developing world challenges, and thereby offer a cheap way to increase efficiencies in these situations.<\/p>\n<p>Once of my ideas, after talking to Kamurj in Armenia was to set in motion an Open Source project to develop a simple, reconfigurable micro-finance package. They need it, and the commercial alternatives are either too expensive or not good enough, and being in a remote location means that the benefits of commercial support operations are often wasted. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d welcome a project in which HP puts it&#8217;s considerable resources and knowledge towards solving this problem. So since this article has very little actual information on the project,   i&#8217;ll be looking for more info&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><bq>But Hewlett-Packard sees a direct connection between the company&#8217;s long-term future and such loans, known as microfinance. Debra L. Dunn, the senior Hewlett-Packard executive in charge of its philanthropy, said a small-loan program could enable consumers in the developing world to afford some of the company&#8217;s computers, printers or digital cameras.<\/bq><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to this NYT article Hewlett-Packard is involved in a projec to standardize and add efficiency to micro-finance institutions in the worlds poorest nations.
