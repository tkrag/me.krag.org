GT claims that the ISP are undermining it&#8217;s business by offering cheap IP-telephony.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana has 20 million inhabitants, but only around a quarter of a million telephone lines. The countries government tried to get help in rebuilding the<br \/>\ninfrastructure from Telecom Malaysia, but the contract was not extended last year, and instead went to Telenor.<\/p>\n<p>But the Norwegian telco didn&#8217;t succeeed with a plan for installing 400.000 fixed-lines in Ghana. It is estimated that GT has a weekly deficit of a million dollars, which simply doesn&#8217;t allow them to install new infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Technical Consultant Tomas Krag of wire.less.dk confirms that IP-telephony is a problem for telcos such as GT. He was a GeekCorps volunteer in the Ghanaian Capital Accra, in 2001, and is familiar with conditions in the country.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In contrast to the traditional telephone market, GT has to pay money everytime a IP-pakket is transportet in or out of Ghana. The money ends in the pockets of one of the Global carriers&#8221;, he says.<\/p>\n<p>The national telecom monopolies in most african countries make a lot of money on telephone conversations initiated abroad. This is because of international agreements that regulate the sharing of revenue for international conversations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time a Ghanaian living abroad calls home, almost half the money is received by the Ghanaian telco&#8221;, explains Tomas Krag.<\/p>\n<p>Since there are many Ghanaians living abroad this income constitues a significant part of the coluntries foreign exchange income.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That is why GT has tried to use the law to react. Since there are no legal precedents concerning VoIP in relation to the telco monopoly, they&#8217;ve argued that VoIP is a breach of telecom regulation and have shut down the ISPs. This situation is not unique for Ghana, but has occured in a number of other countries&#8221;, he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Tomas Krag is convinced that VoIP is only behind a very small part of the telco&#8217;s losses. The problem is exacerbated by continuously falling costs for international telephony, and a general fall in the length and number of international phone-calls.<\/p>\n<p>Last week the situation lead to violent demonstrations in a number of places in Ghana. The protesters were complaining that most publ\u00e6ic phones are no longer functioning, while GT is still selling phonecards, that are useless because the clients cannot use them.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time it is becoming more and more difficult to call Ghana from abroad. A single number may have to be dialled again and again for hours before a connection is made.<\/p>\n<p>More info: http:\/\/www.balancingact-africa.com\/news\/back\/balancing-act_145.html<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a number of requests (well actually two), I&#8217;ve thrown together a quick translation of the article on Ghana Telecom in which I am heavily quoted.
