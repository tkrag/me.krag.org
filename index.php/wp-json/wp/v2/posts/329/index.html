Modules will be led by Charles Nesson, Geoffrey Kirkman, Colin Maclay, Andrew McLaughlin, Jim Moore, Ethan Zuckerman, Diane Cabell and John Palfrey, co-coordinated by Wendy Koslow with Teaching Fellows Urs Gasser, Isabel Neto, Rebecca Brackley and Nandan Kamath (Head Teaching Fellow).<\/p>\n<p>Each module will then be used as a platform for discussion and the sharing of information, opinions and personal experiences between and among participants. This process will often be facilitated and moderated by the Teaching Fellows.
