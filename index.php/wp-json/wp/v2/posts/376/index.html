There is a huge difference between license-free UNregulated spectrum, and the license-free but regulated spectrum that is used by WiFi, and will be used (partly) by WiMAX in the future. <\/p>\n<p>While this is true, it doesn&#8217;t change the objective argument that Bill Thompson is trying to make, and which I can&#8217;t really decide if I agree with. Namely that there are good examples of successful usage of licensed, regulated Spectrum in the developing world, in Community Radio and especially GSM, while there  are still few examples of successful use of UNlicensed, regulated spectrum such as 2.4 GHz.<\/p>\n<p>In fact there are <a href=\"http:\/\/glocal.crimsonblog.com\/archives20030201.html#20010\">reports<\/a> of spectrum wars in Africa, where wireless ISP&#8217;s using the 2.4GHz spectrum simply boost power to get through other ISP&#8217;s signals. <\/p>\n<p>I realize of course that these Amp-wars are caused by a lack of regulation, and not by a lack of license requirements, but in nations that have neither the skills nor the technical asets to control and regulate effectively the difference may be insignificant.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I am a huge supporter of WiFi for the developing world, and have invested a year of my life, and a good deal of money I don&#8217;t have into the belief that WiFi and other Open, disruptive technologies can provide opportunities to the developing world that are not currently available. But that only really increases my scpeticism when large corporations suddenly through all their might behind an idea that up until 6 months ago nobody really cared about, with the exception of Simon Woodside, myself and maybe a few hundred other people around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>The scepticism comes from a fear that by pushing this technology too hard, we may be killing it off. Introducing it commercially to countries that don&#8217;t have the wherewithall to handle the regulation (which is a more difficult task in unlicensed spectrum, than in licensed spectrum), may result in the unregulated chaos that is NOT what we need for wireless to fullfill it&#8217;s potential.<\/p>\n<p>Probably what we need is hardware and software that makes it easier to be a good citizen in the ether, by dynamically handling signal-strength, directionality etc.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday, I wrote this item about an article on BBC&#8217;s news site relating to WiFi hype in a developing world context.
