One moment I feel like I&#8217;ve been away for a month, the next I wonder how what feels like one long day in Ghana has suddenly bridged through a weekend, reaching tuesday without a single de-tour.<\/p>\n<p>I have to say, this rocks! Such an opportunity, basically thrown at my feet. 3 months, a new culture, new people, the hope (and the possibility) of making a difference to one small company trying to make a business in a world that is not necessarily favourable to that kind of venture. <\/p>\n<p><i> I&#8217;m truly sorry if this drivel is just a continuous reiteration and public washing of my infatuation with this whole concept, but as those of you who read my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.t.krag.org\/\">homepage<\/a> know, i tend to get a little carried away when drivelling about something that excites me&#8230;.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been in Accra for  4 days now, and the following is just a tiny part of all the things that have been happening:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Food:<\/b> I&#8217;ve had an assortment of Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian food so far. All of which has been delicious, so while I was sure I&#8217;d loose weight here, I am now no-longer quite sure&#8230;.. Amongst the delicacies that I&#8217;ve had <\/p>\n<p>ar the following: <br \/>Fufu with groundnut soup and Bushmeat (I think it may have been Guinea Fowl, Fufu with Groundnut soup and Chicken, Jollof Rice with fried fish, fried plantains with palave sauce (Ktoumerai), fried yams with red-red, and various other delicacies&#8230;.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Accomodations:<\/b> We are living in the upscale part of town called Osu, where there are a lot of ex-patriates, fast-food restaurants and fancy stores, as well as a general price-level that seems to include the inconspicuous &#8220;tourist tax&#8221;. We share a rather large compound with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekcorps.org\">geekcorps<\/a> (which is coincidentally pronounced jeekcorpse in Ghanaian english) office, as well as 24-hour guards, and Rose and Richard who live out back, cook, shop, clean and do the laundry for us&#8230;. It&#8217;s quite different to have 2 people who actualkly are payed to work for you, but being a bit of a lazy bum, it&#8217;s something I have gotten used to quite quickly. The only negative thing I can say about our accomodations, is the fact that they are about an hours commute from my partner business, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.africaexpress.com\">Africa Express<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>The Entertainment:<\/b> Almost every day here has included some form of entertainment, starting the very first night on the way from the airport with live High-Life music (a local mix of reggae, pop and african style music) at dinner.<br \/> Saturday night we went to the national theatre for a brilliant ghanaian stand-up comedy show, by KSM. Although most of the jokes were about the recent elections, the state of democracy and similar subjects, and quite a few of them played with differences between various Ghanaian languages (mostly Twi, Ewe and Ga) I understood enough of what was going on, to make me laugh heartily for quite a while.<br \/>Sunday, Jason, Tim and I took of before 6 to get to the national stadium to secure tickets for the afternoon World Cup Qualifier football (soccer) game between The Black Stars (National Team) of Ghana, and the Lone Stars of Liberia (George Weahs Team). Although it took us about 3 hours and a lot of interaction with our new friend Modesto, to procure the tickets, just that excercise was a grewat opportunity to learn about Ghana. And apart from the fact that the Ghanaians lost 1-3 to what was on paper a inferior team, the atmosphere and fun made up for it abundantly. There are enough Liberian refugees in Ghana, that the victory celebration was almost like a home team victory&#8230;..<br \/>Monday is Hash House Harrier (HHH) day in Accra. The Accra Hash (for those that are as ignorant about the HHH as I was a few days ago read their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gthhh.com\/\">homepage<\/a>)&#8230; Basically the HHH term themselves <i>&#8220;A Drinking Club, with a Running problem&#8221;<\/i>. The event included a short run through some of Accra&#8217;s back streets, and a serious drinking bash, with lot&#8217;s of club, star and Gulder (beer)&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Definitely something i&#8217;ll try and do every monday!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The Internet cafe is closing, so more will have to wait&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is it tuesday already?
