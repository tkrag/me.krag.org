Solar-powered, autonomous connectivity. <\/p>\n<p><bq>The Solacam (that&#8217;s right, no &#8220;r&#8221;) uses a mixture of technologies to deliver a remote digital video signal back to your network. Chief among them is use of the Proxim Tsunami MP.11, an 802.11b-based, point-to-multipoint backhaul solution with a range up to about 12 miles. The Solacam itself is an IP video camera mounted on a freestanding pole in a remote location, powered by a battery that is charged by a solar panel that&#8217;s also mounted on the pole. A Yagi directional antenna points the low-res video back to home base (assuming it uses the MP.11 subscriber station&#8230; the pole could also house the MP.11 base station). The MP.11 and battery are housed in an all-weather enclosure.<\/bq><\/p>\n[via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gizmodo.com\/>Gizmodo<\/a>]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Proxim, Hutton Ship Solar-Powered Wireless Camera Interesting product shipping from US manufacturer Hutton Communications A combination of wireless gear including a directional yagi antenna, a security camera, and a solar power solution.
