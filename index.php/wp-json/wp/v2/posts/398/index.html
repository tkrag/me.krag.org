I have a  truckload of impressions in my mind to deal with, scores of new friends, dozens of ideas, and in general a very busy and exciting time ahead (optimism rocks).<br \/>\nDureing the weeks mad camp, I practically carried my PalmPilot around with me all the time. I used it to jot notes of the actual sessions, but even more importantly to jot down words, thoughts and ideas throughout the week. <\/p>\n<p>On the plane journey home, having slept only about 5 hours total in the last 2 nights, I put myself in stream-of.consciousness mode and merged my on-the-spot emotions with these obscure notes from the week. This is the result:<\/p>\n<p><bq><br \/>\nsource code<br \/>\ncode is free<br \/>\nfree to hack<\/p>\n<p>hack hack hack<br \/>\nsecure<br \/>\nthe hangover.<\/p>\n<p>gunner gunner wojtek wojtek<br \/>\nwojtek wojtek gunner gunner over<\/p>\n<p>low connection, slow connection, no connection. I ping, I ping, I ping, but noone answers. The world is empty.<br \/>\nluckily. Right here, next to me, a hive of inquiring minds. Probing, pinging, hacking.<br \/>\nMy mind.<\/p>\n<p>my mind this morning<br \/>\ni&#8217;m feeling<br \/>\ndynamic, diabolic<br \/>\ndyne:bolic<br \/>\nAND WHY IS THAT? I ask. Again and again, as morning becomes circle, becomes session. Why is that? you ask. What came before?<\/p>\n<p>wakeup call,<br \/>\nstumble to the bathroom.<br \/>\nSuddenly remember that croatian army toilets are non-intuitive interfaces. Stumble back.<br \/>\nAgain. Like an ancient screensaver.  Again.<br \/>\nshower. A failed attempt to dampen the pain of my thundering frontal lobe. but then. Breakfast. Chit chat, morning circle. Colors. Groove. Energy disperses and recollects in another plane of being.<\/p>\n<p>What a week. Who are these people with such extreme inquisitive minds. These heroes from all over the world? Who are they?<br \/>\nI hand them a little nugget of my knowledge. They leap at it. Tear at it. Expose it&#8217;s faults. Shine on it&#8217;s strengths. Remix. Reinforce. Rethink.<\/p>\n<p>As morning becomes circle and reenacts the previous day. As session flows into freeform, and training is replaced by learning, i absorb. It is the nature of this beast. It will pry open the fortress of the mind, and force a retreat. Never before. Never in so few days have i reconsidered so many assumptions. And reinforced so many beliefs. <\/p>\n<p>how? Why? And why here?<br \/>\nRouting<br \/>\ndynamic routing<br \/>\ndynamic routing of minds, conversations, relationships. A gently coaxed dynamic routing protocol.<br \/>\ncoaxed, nudged, guided into new paths. Always trying to find the optimal path between minds.<br \/>\nA geeky metaphor but so appropriate for this place outside of time.<\/p>\n<p>in retrospect i find it hard.<br \/>\nHard to focus. Sleep deprivation will do that.<br \/>\nAs i remember 4am discussions. Lack of mental faculties apty replaced by ample volume. Remember exhaustion from answering questions. Asking questions. Questioning both questions and answers.<br \/>\nremember the healing properties of an adriatic backcrawl. Remind myself of the beginning of the week. So far away now. so remote. as i think back to sessions. Skillshare. Screwdriver drills and the bizarre. I taste again the salty yoghurt, the pivo and the soy. I hear again the voices of fifty new friends. Kind words, warm hearts, amazing people.<br \/>\nThe quiet excitement of the moment. The infinitely less quiet excitement of some of the other moments. My face is tired from smiling for a week. My mind is tired from being open. My body is tired from being attached to this beer drinking machine at the end of my neck. I am exhausted. excited. exstatic. explosive.<\/bq><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So I&#8217;m back from the incredible adventure that was SummerSource.
