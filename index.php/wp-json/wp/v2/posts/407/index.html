It has taken us one and a half years to get to such a concrete idea of what it is we are trying to do. one and a half years of hard work, confusing strategy meetings and very little income. one and a half years of intense learning, enriching cooperation, and fighting to remain true to our ideals.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\ni had no idea it was this difficult to try and make a difference. and i&#8217;m not talking about the difficulties in getting funding. i&#8217;m talking about the difficulties in congealing your ideals into a substantive, doable project. and then getting funding.<\/p>\n<p>oh well, back to the next  4 days. i&#8217;ll be here, in a santorini beach hotel, trying to get perhaps one of the most important documents in my career written. and this time there is no excuse. <\/p>\n<p>the proposals i&#8217;ve written in the past have all been easy. easy because we mostly knew we didn&#8217;t stand a chance, and therefore it wasn&#8217;t that important. don&#8217;t get me wrong. last year, around this time, when we wrote a proposal for the world banks infodev grant, we worked our asses of. probably spent over 2 man-months, which in a 2 and a half person org is a lot of time and effort. but in a sense we all knew it was a practice run. the fact that we had no experience as an org meaning that we didn&#8217;t stand much of a chance. the fact that we weren&#8217;t very coherent or practical when it came to explaining our project didn&#8217;t help either. <\/p>\n<p>this time though, as i said, we&#8217;re in a good dialogue with a prospective funder. they seem to accept our skillsets and professionalism, and all it takes is to write a smashing proposal that will convince the sceptics that are a requirement for every funders board of directors. <\/p>\n<p>and quite frankly, it scares the shit out of me. <\/p>\n<p>and i have to do this in a holiday hotel on santorini, where i don&#8217;t even know whether i&#8217;ll be able to get my laptop online. this time it&#8217;s for real&#8230;.. wish me luck.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>the next 4 days are going to be something of an experiment. i&#8217;m in santorini, at the santorini palace hotel in firostefani. signe is here to participate in a planning meeting on hybrid ventilation systems. originally i thought this would be a great chance to get a last week of sun in before the misery [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[5,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The next 4 days &bull; krag.be<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2003\/09\/23\/the-next-4-days\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"The next 4 days &bull; krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"the next 4 days are going to be something of an experiment. i&#8217;m in santorini, at the santorini palace hotel in firostefani. signe is here to participate in a planning meeting on hybrid ventilation systems. originally i thought this would be a great chance to get a last week of sun in before the misery [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2003\/09\/23\/the-next-4-days\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2003-09-23T09:09:31+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Tomas\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"3 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/\",\"name\":\"krag.be\",\"description\":\"I am multiple and various - Tomas A.
