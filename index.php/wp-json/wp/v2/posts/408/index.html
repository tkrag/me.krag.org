I&#8217;ve been on the road for about 22 days of the month, and for the first time I&#8217;ve really felt the downsides of my massive Dell Inspiron 8100, which weighs in at over 3.5 kg with the dual batteries and everything. Yes it&#8217;s a great machine with an incredible display, but to be honest I mostly use it in 2 places, at home and at the office. <\/p>\n<p>I originally got it, because having a single machine to work with everywhere made a lot of sense, but more and more of my work is done on-line anyway, and my syncing skills are improving quickly. and the more I travel, the more I fancy an ultra-lite laptop, perhaps combined with an external monitor and keyboard at the office. <\/p>\n<p>There is absolutely no way I can afford a new laptop at the moment, and that will probably be true for the foreseeable future, but that doesn&#8217;t prevent me from dreaming, and this linux-baby (Sharp MM10 revamped) from <a href=\"http:\/\/emperorlinux.com\">Emperor Linux<\/a> is absolutely gorgeous. And the fact that it can be an external harddrive through a USB 2.0 dock, is really enticing. And I&#8217;ve long wanted a crusoe processor, for their low-power tech, and because I like the idea of supporting someone other than Intel and AMD for a change. <\/p>\n<p>Perhaps I can save some by buying the Sharp notebook, and installing linux myself. On the other hand, having emperor&#8217;s word for the fact that the main features are supported is quite a nice thing too. Oh well, keep dreaming \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><bq>EmperorLinux supplies the Sharp Actius MM10 laptop pre-installed with Linux.<br \/>\nWe call the Sharp MM10 running Linux the &#8220;Meteor&#8221;. It is the thinnest and lightest Linux laptop we have ever offered. The Meteor is about the size of a very thin textbook (one-half-inch thick), and yet 2-pound feather-weight is a &#8220;real&#8221; computer. With the innovative USB cradle, you can even mount the system drive from another PC to sync your data! The Meteor MM10 features full Linux hardware support for: X, sound, USB, PCMCIA, WiFi, networking, and more.<\/bq><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EmperorLinux &#8220;Meteor&#8221; Linux Laptop This past month I have travelled a lot.
