Also, it would require all computers manufactured in Vietnam to be sold with open-source products installed on them.<br \/>\n<bq>&#8220;We are trying step by step to eliminate Microsoft,&#8221; said Nguyen Trung Quynh of Vietnam&#8217;s Ministry of Science and Technology. Quynh and other government tech officials want Vietnam to be on the cutting edge of an international movement to embrace open-source software &#8212; products that can be downloaded from the Internet for free and perform the same tasks as Microsoft Windows or Office.<\/bq><br \/>\nIronically, this seems to be a plan which main target is to stem the widespread pirating of software, to comply with a trade agreement with the United States (and the World Trade Organisation). So the US forces them to not use US products. <\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.silicon.com\/software\/os\/print.htm?TYPE=story&#038;AT=39116677-39024651t-40000022c\">the MAlaysian governement<\/a> has created a fund of USD 36 million, to support start-ups developing Open Source software. <\/p>\n<p>While, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/200311050590.html\">this article<\/a>,<br \/>\n<bq>The South African government and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research recently launched Project Meraka (a Sotho word for shared grazing), a resource centre where government departments, companies and individuals will be able to obtain neutral open source information, such as where to find products and support.<\/bq><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s busy times for the Free Software movement around the world.
