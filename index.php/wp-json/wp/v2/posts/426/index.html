And it&#8217;s an exciting picture being formed. 2004 has the potenital, to be the most exciting year of my career yet. OK, if you really think about it, that goes for every other year as well, but nevertheless, this one feels different. <\/p>\n<p>2004 will be the year where the funding we secured late last year from the Open Society Institute, will result in an actual project.
