Thanks for all the fresh perspectives, the hecklebot and the sense of humour.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly. The most interesting people i met so far are some of the grassroot hanging around, such as the locative.net guys<\/p>\n<p>In general I have noticed 3 main themes at this years conference.<\/p>\n<p>1. Blogging for Democracy.<br \/>\nMondays digital democracy teach-in and a few sessions since have all been about the revolution in emocracy that was the howard dean campaign and the blogspace thing. Sorry, but it&#8217;s sometimes hard to take it seriously. It&#8217;s real rich to have americans blog about a revolution in emocray that most of all seems like a bad hack to make a basically deficit democracy function in a half-way useful manner. I would compare the us democracy to a highly monolithic incomprehensible chunck of software, and the current &#8216;revolution&#8217; as some particularly effective, yet unruly perl code. It&#8217;s revolutionary only because it works, and it work only because the original code is so f&#8230;. up. No offense.<\/p>\n<p>2. Social Software.<br \/>\nFirst of all, it seems to me that most of the so-called social software systems that are being talked about, i.e. orkut, friendster, linkedin etc, are very us centric. Perhaps it&#8217;s because the US is the last country to discover that daily interaction has moved away from the PC, and onto the mobile phone? Perhaps it&#8217; just that the need to digitize your relationships and make them explicit and visual is a fundamentally american itch?<br \/>\nSecondly i just can&#8217;t seemt o bring myself to care about this stuff. sure, i&#8217;m on orkut and LinkedIn, and I was on Six Degrees about 5 years ago. i never used any of them for anything ensible, and while it&#8217;s &#8216;cool&#8217; to surf friends of your friends profiles, it&#8217;s hard to see where it becomes useful to me, or even how i am ever going to b fascinated by these systems.<\/p>\n<p>3. Mobile (cellphone) software<br \/>\nSorry guys, but the US was 5 years behind, 5 years ago, and now that those 5 years have passed perhaps you&#8217;re only 3 years behind. Bring in the South Korean&#8217;s, the japanese, the estonians, even the danes. When I was in charge of mobile development at Icon Medialab in 2000\/2001 we made som demo-apps which would probably still fascinate a large part of this crowd. I&#8217;m sorry, but there is nothing Emerging about cellphone systems. At least not the ones I have heard about here this week.<\/p>\n<p>I want more tech and less emergence. I want more presentations like Oliver Masciarottes excellent overview of Ultra-WideBand wireless on tuesday. More Locative.net. more hacking. and specifically mor people from those other parts of the world, who bring a perspective that I haven&#8217;t already seen on the a-list bloggers sites. Oh, and don&#8217;t get me started on this whole a-list thing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>O&#8217;Reilly Network: O&#8217;Reilly Network &#8212; 2004 Emerging Technology Conference Coverage [Jan. 16, 2004] Here&#8217;s a few comments from my tke on emerging tech 2004 in san diego.
