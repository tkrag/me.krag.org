I love to see my name in the media \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>And thanks to everyone who helped me celebrate my birthday at geekhalla in Accra yesterday. It was a great birthday, but I am a little dissapointed that you all didn&#8217;t finish the beer I bought. Now I have to drink it all myself.<\/p>\n<p>Special thanks to Modestu, Hans, Ally, Tim, Jean-Luc and Ethan for the wonderful presents. (If I forgot anyone forgive me, the heat is turning my brain into mush!).<\/p>\n<p>Amongst the things I got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a lovely Strawberry Daiquiri consisting of canned Russian Vodka, Strawberry Tang and boiled water. (Ethan really knows how to make the most of available ingredients)<\/li>\n<li>A beautiful turqoise piece of Kente cloth with the woven inscription &#8220;Happy Birthday Thomas&#8221; (Thanks Modestu, that is really beautiful)<\/li>\n<li>A Mary, Mother of Jesus plastic nightlight. (Thanks Tim, forgive me for my lack of ecstatic enthusiasm \ud83d\ude42<\/li>\n<li>A glass of Nutella (Thanks Ally, nothing like a thick, creamy chocolate substance at 38 degrees Celsius)<\/li>\n<li>A gift-box of Ghanaian chocolate. (From my fellow countryman Hans, who saw the posting on slashdot, went to this very site, saw the invitation and popped by with a present)<\/li>\n<li>A Pocket guide to great xxx. (Thanks Jean-Luc, I&#8217;m sure that will come in handy when my lovely girlfriend hopefully visits me here)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It was a great party, even though both the water and the electricity went of during the evening. Lots of people, Ghanaians as well as ex-pats, and lots of beer in many variations. Thanks to everyone&#8230;<\/p>\n<p> And thanks to Jason, Tim, Peter and Audrey who all rolled over to let me win at pool!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A quick thank you to slashdot for accepting Jasons post on saturday.
