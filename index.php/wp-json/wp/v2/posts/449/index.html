And I never really have. I&#8217;ve always known that that was mostly true because I always had enough of it to get by. <\/p>\n<p>I grew up lucky. I mean the lucky of a white, male child of 2 well-educated parents in one of the socially well-functioning country. My family is safely in the upper half of middle class. I never lacked for anything important. I am also lucky to be smart enough that I never had a problem finding (and keeping) a decently paying job. So money has never had much sway over my attention, and I&#8217;m quite proud of that.<\/p>\n<p>For the past 2-3 years I have gradually moved myself (profesionally) into the non-profit technology field, getting more and more involved in ict&#8217;s for development, and having less and less money. And money continued to be of little interest to me. As long as I have had enough. And I mean enough in a social context. Enough that I could, in practice, livge the life that my peers in Copenhagen live. Go out once in a while, go on vacation with my family, and even buy a toy\/gadget once in a while. The plan was to make that possible by doing some consulting work in parallel to my work with ICT&#8217;s for development. The truth, is rather less sustainable. I have been living of my saving, and some money that I got as an early inheritance from my grandparents. The money is running out, or more precisely the money ran out a while ago. And while I wish I could till say that money is not important to me, I am gradually beginning to see the truth in what I have always known. It is not important, as long as you feel your needs are met. I shamefully admit that the idea of entering a period with very ittle money, even if I will always have enough to pay the bills, is very stressful. There&#8217;s a dull tenseness in my stomache when I think about continuing the non-profit work that I am involved in now. We have some funding to continue our project, but it&#8217;s not enough to pay me the half-time wage that I feel I would need in order not to worry too much about financial issues. On the other hand I have a commitment to pull off the Wireless Roadshow. A project that has been my dream for the past year, and that now, where e finally have funding, I will push myself to do to the utmost of my ability.<\/p>\n<p>But the bottom line is, I am feeling the extent of my own vulnerability. Feeling the stress of working on something this different. I long to NOT have to care about money. And I long to work in a dedicated team of people who share at least some of my goals and visions, and in which we have a clear idea of where we are headed. In stead, I am working, in practice, only with Sebastian, our vision is unclear except that we are headed in the right general direction, and I have started worrying about money.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don&#8217;t really care about money.
