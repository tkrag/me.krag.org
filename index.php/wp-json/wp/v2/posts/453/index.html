I feel like I haven&#8217;t had a full work week at the office since early december, and it&#8217;s not really a feeling i relish, since there is so much to do, and we are finally getting somewhere with oyur own projects here.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nSo for a short while a few weeks ago, we talked about cancelling our vacation, and trying to postpone it for later this year. My knee is still acting up from the surgery I had in december, and my back, while almost infinitely better is still not perfect, so we thought about waiting with the active outdoor vacation until things were calmer.<br \/>\nThe truth is, though, that starting this summer, we are really going to be pushing the Wireless Roadshow and by late summer, early fall, if all goes well, i will be on the road more or less constantly for a while. So the chances of postponing a vacation this year seemed slim to none. <\/p>\n<p>At the same time, I sort of had this feeling that after a winter that was pretty tough emotionally, for both of us, and physically, for me, it might not be a bad idea to relax together for a few weeks, get to know each other again, and spend some time talking about our common dreams and hopes for the future. And I&#8217;m so far behind with my work anyway, that anything that waited this long, will safely wait another 3 weeks. <\/p>\n<p>So here we go, off on vacation to British Columbia, Canada. To visit friends, hike, and perhaps even kayak. To recover and prepare for a travel intense, busy year ahead. And to stay away from the Grizzlies&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not expecting to blog for the next 3 weeks, so I wish you all a good 3 weeks, and here are links to some of my favourite blogs to keep you entertained until then:<\/p>\n<p>Gadgets Galore: http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/<br \/>\nEthan&#8217;s Blog: http:\/\/blogs.law.harvard.edu\/ethan\/<br \/>\nAtanu Dey: http:\/\/www.deeshaa.org\/<br \/>\nBlog.org: http:\/\/blog.org\/<br \/>\nMuni-wireless: http:\/\/www.muniwireless.com\/reports\/<br \/>\nGeneral Wifi News: http:\/\/wifinetnews.com\/<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About 9 months ago, Signe and I planned a 3 week vacation in April to go visit our very close friends in Vancouver, hike, kayak and generally recover from what I was expecting to be a fairly exhausting winter of work. instead it has been a fairly exhausting winter of travel, with quite a few [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[9,1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Vacation time is coming &bull; krag.be<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2004\/04\/16\/vacation-time-is-coming\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Vacation time is coming &bull; krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"About 9 months ago, Signe and I planned a 3 week vacation in April to go visit our very close friends in Vancouver, hike, kayak and generally recover from what I was expecting to be a fairly exhausting winter of work. instead it has been a fairly exhausting winter of travel, with quite a few [&hellip;]\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/krag.be\/index.php\/2004\/04\/16\/vacation-time-is-coming\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"krag.be\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2004-04-16T19:10:00+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@tkrag\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Tomas\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"2 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/krag.be\/\",\"name\":\"krag.be\",\"description\":\"I am multiple and various - Tomas A.
