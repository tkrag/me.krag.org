Hughes,  who has done more wireless networking in remote regions than almost anyone I can think of. He talks about his efforts to set up the worlds highest internet caf\u00e9 at the Mt. Everest Base Camp, and how he used similar technology to provide access to other arfeasa of the himalayas.<\/p>\n<p>Add to that a few articles that I haven&#8217;t gotten around to reading yet, but that seem as if they add value to the issue as well, and it&#8217;s a recommended read for people with or without previous knowledge of wirleess and\/or technology in development.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The magazine that styles itself &#8220;The First monthly magazine on ict4d&#8221; has a new issue on the streets, and this one is all about Wireless Communications in the developing world.
