During a routine google search marcell&#8217;s machine uddenly returned <a href=\"http:\/\/dozomo.24hdc.com\/\">this<\/a> instead of the normal google front-end. Turns out, that a flock of, in my humble opinion, frankly immature and annoying, <a href=\"http:\/\/24hdc.com\/\">hackers<\/a> were staging a &#8220;24 hour dotcom&#8221; event. <\/p>\n<p>In just 24 hours they coded and deployed the dozomo meta-search engine, including a front-end, a mozilla\/firefox search plugin and a safari keywords file. So far so good. A good effort, a neat conference event, and a decent hack (although the search front-end is pretty buggy and flawed.<br \/>\nThat they extensively (some would say exhaustively) documented the whole thing on-line, and went ahead and offered a pseudo-IPO on ebay was actually quite a clever hack.<\/p>\n<p>UNFORTUNATELY, in a time-honored tradition of young geeks and adolescents, they then preceeded to scream for attention in a rude and obnoxious way, Using the in-conference proxy server they started redirecting http requests to google, msn and other major search engines to their own <a href\"http:\/\/dozomo.24hdc.com\/\">page <\/a>. This is sort of like a kid baking bread to impress his\/her parents and then proceeding to intentionally plaster the entire kitchen with wet dough, just to be completely certain that they were heard. <\/p>\n<p>That the proxy hack actually managed to break their own brainchild  (when clicking on page 2 of a search result page from google, the proxy hack would redirect that httpo request and return you to the dozomo frontpage), just made it even more pathetic.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry guys, but there were a lot of people at the conference trying to get some work done, and it&#8217;s not ok to force your shite on them against their will, even for the sake of a conference art event. hand out flyers next time, and you&#8217;ll probably get a lot more friends. <\/p>\n<p>Personally, like Wendy Seltzer [<a title=\"Wendy's Blog: Legal Tags: WOS: Dozomo\" href=\"http:\/\/wendy.seltzer.org\/blog\/archives\/2004\/06\/12\/wos_dozomo.html\">Wendy&#8217;s Blog: Legal Tags: WOS: Dozomo<\/a>], I was lucky enough to be running the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freehaven.net\/tor\/\">Tor anonymizing proxy<\/a>, and wasn&#8217;t affected by this particular hack.
