Responsible for my own destiny, our success, and a lot of other high-brow things.  It just happened this way. I found the ideal business in ict&#8217;s for the developing world, in which i had more fun, more fullfillment, and more interesting challenges in 3 month than i would have in a year of web agency, dot-not mayhem. I knew that that was what i wanted to work with, and i took the only path that presented itself to me. being my own boss.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s haunting me now. I can&#8217;t help but feel misplaced in so many ways. I can&#8217;t help but dream of having a regular job, with colleagues, limited responsibility, and the ability to run away screaming if it all becomes too much. Perhaps that&#8217;s really what it is, a fear of being trapped. trapped in a construct i invented, trapped in a job that i don&#8217;t really want, but can&#8217;t run away from, because that would be running away from myself and my dream. <\/p>\n<p>i think that&#8217;s probably a large part of it. it&#8217;s a responsibility i never wanted, but having taken it upon myself, despite this fat, i need to deal with it or find a way out that leaves at least a few bridges standing. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well mine wasn&#8217;t.
