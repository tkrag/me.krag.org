More info here: <a href=\"http:\/\/sdu.ictp.it\/lowbandwidth\/\">ICTP-SDU: Lowbandwidth Optimization Techniques<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve given lectures and had lab sessions on Traffic Shaping, and Bandwidth Monitoring, as well as some very basic linux firewalling stuff.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s about 40 colleagues here from all over sub-saharan africa, as well as Bolivia, Cuba, India, Rumania and probably a lot of countries i have missed. <\/p>\n<p>There are some amazing participants, and some brilliant lecturors here. <\/p>\n<p>Richard Stubbs from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, is a fountain of wisdom on overall strategies fro managing bandwidth in a large university setting (12,000 students) with way too little bandwidth (about 18 Mbit\/s).<\/p>\n<p>Olatunde Abiona, from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, adds another experienced voice to the fray, and is another new acquaintance for me to add to my growing list of gifted tehnology trainers. <\/p>\n<p>Duane Wessels is just teaching a class on Web proxying with Squid, and for those of you who don&#8217;t know who Duane is, take a look <a href=\"http:\/\/www.squid-cache.org\/volunteers.html\">here<\/a>. Duane is the original author of Squid, which in turn is the most widely used web proxy anywhere. He also wrote one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/worldcat.org\/isbn\/156592536X\">definitive guides on webcaching<\/a>, and he happens to be a great teacher too.<\/p>\n<p>Les Cottrell from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, was here until this morning, and he is an authority on ultra-high bandwidth applications, as well as being one of the brains behind the <a href=\"http:\/\/www-iepm.slac.stanford.edu\/pinger\/\">pingEr<\/a> project, which measures latency over time to as many universities as possible, and uses it to estimate the quality of connections around the world. <\/p>\n<p>Of course this is just a small sample of the great people that have made it to Trieste. Many of the lectures are on-line in QuickTime format <a href=\"http:\/\/sdu.ictp.it\/dl\/2006\/1006_bandwidth\/index.html\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, This is the first ICT workshop I&#8217;ve done since coming back from <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.africasource2.tacticaltech.org\/\">Africa Source 2<\/a> last winter, and it&#8217;s a timely reminder of how much i&#8217;ve missed this type of work.<\/p>\n<p>Let me just repeat this here for future reference. Just in case, i end up forgetting&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I love to teach at technology workshops, especially when some of the participants are from the developing world and have developing world problems. It is what I do well, it is my passion, and in this world I have found some of the most intelligent, fascinating and fun friends a person could ever ask for.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am currently back in Trieste, with my good friends Marco and Carlo, and this time the topic is Bandwidth Optimization.
