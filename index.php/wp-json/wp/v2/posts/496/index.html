Therefore, bandwidth is probably the single most critical resource at the disposal of a modern organisation.<\/p>\n<p> The goal of this book is to provide practical information on how to gain the largest possible benefit from your connection to the Internet. By applying the monitoring and optimisation techniques discussed here, the effectiveness of your network can be significantly improved.<\/p>\n<p> We hope that you find these materials and this website useful.
