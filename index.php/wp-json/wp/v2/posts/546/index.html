I need change, after the part-time limbo that i&#8217;ve been in since i left All Africa, and my paternity leave behind me. Arthur is well-ensconced in his daycare routine, and with i&#8217;ve gotten used to life as a father. My desire to travel, is tangibly smaller than it was before, so life as a free-lance\/volunteer ICT4dev wizard isn&#8217;t quite as appealing as it once was. And rather than pretend that&#8217;s what i&#8217;m still doing, and supplementing it with occasional freelance work, i think it&#8217;s about time i move on.<\/p>\n<p>And since i can&#8217;t quite wrap my head around any of the start-up ideas i have, a job seems just what the doctor ordered.<br \/>\nFrankly, i&#8217;d love to start a <a href=\"http:\/\/booksprint.info\/\">Book Sprint<\/a>-based tech-publisher for <a href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/\">Creative-Commons<\/a> licensed books, and i&#8217;d be excited about actually starting a <a href=\"http:\/\/teachtech.dk\/\">Linux-based training company<\/a>, like i meant to do in spring. BUT, I&#8217;m starting to realize that i don&#8217;t want to do any of these things alone, that whatever i do, i need day-to-day interaction and sparring with others, the feeling of achieving some goal together. And neither of these startups will give me that, mostly because Copenhagen seems to be woefully short of people with my particular brand of strangeness.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, i want some stability, a project that lasts more than a week or 2, and i want to share that project with others. My family and I could certainly use a second income, after years of fairly eratic income on my side, so a job feels like the right thing for me at this point.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Relax, have fun, be more&#8230;..
