I&#8217;d written a few blog-like pages on what was then my website, but those have been lost to the world by now. I started blogging after hearing <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Justin_Hall\">Justin Hall<\/a> speak about his blog at links.net (I gorget where he spoke, but then it has been 12 years). <\/p>\n<p>The blog I started back then was hand-coded HTML, with a few CGI scripts to generate a calendar of posts, and a logo designed by a colleague I had at Tele Danmark Internet. OK, so it looks a bit dated, but this was 1998.<\/p>\n<p>I ran that blog for almost 2 years, before moving to Movable Type, and since to finally to WordPress, at which point I also switched to the multiplicity.dk domain.<\/p>\n<p>In those 12 years there have been a lot of periods with little or no blogging, and for the past 3 years or so I haven&#8217;t blogged a lot. I think this weekends <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barcampnairobi.com\/\">Barcamp Nairobi<\/a>, has made me think about picking up again. <\/p>\n<p>The tecch challenges we have at Refugees United, seem like the perfect kind of thing to blog about. Perhaps clear my mind by writing them down, perhaps even soliciting some feedback. <\/p>\n<p>Also, and on a more personal note, perhaps rekindling this blog will help me keep in touch with my friends abroad, now that i spend significantly less time travelling and going to events. Meeting old and new friends in Nairobi this week, has certainly made me miss all those trips more, and the spirit of sharing, and the common ground that they bring. <\/p>\n<p>(On the other hand, I really miss my wife and son right now, so it&#8217;s not like i&#8217;m going to be travelling much more anytime in the next 18 years \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p> In any case, enjoy the embarassment that was the late 90&#8217;s<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>12 years ago today, on the 14th of June 1998, during the World Cup in France, I posted my first ever blog post.
