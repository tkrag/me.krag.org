Unconfirmed rumours state that a number of competitors are consiering a protest, to the World Federation of Pub Trivia Challenges (WFPTC), because there is some doubt as to the validity of having entire teams consisting geeks, who are in essence professionals in the field of Trivia. However, we are convinced that we ollowed every possible WFPTC ruling in terms of team selection and the intake of illegal, performance-enhancing substances.<\/p>\n<p>The Geekhalla Trivia Team, was in fact so supreme in all aspects of the game, that Babak decided, in a show of almost touching sportsmanship, to give away the answer to the first question by shouting it to the entire pub. In later question rounds, possibly discounting the one on local Ghanaian affairs, we managed to be very consistant in our answers due to a concerted team effort. Unfortunately we missed what is arguably the second most important round of the quiz, because nobody on the team had read the latest issue of FHM magazine, and therefore we were out of touch with their optimistic estimate of a world population of less than 4 billion. Also there were long discussions as to how the rukling board, could possibly disagree with the fact that the answer to at least 6 of the questions was indeed &#8220;Eddie Murphy&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most impressive parts of the victory stemmed from the obvious lack of a British team member, for what was arguably the most Anglo-centric Pub Trivia Challenge we had ever participated in. The team managed through a number of highly precise guesses, most of which were &#8220;Eddie Murphy&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the end, the winning margin of the Geekh4lla Trivia Team was more than doubled when the team scribe, Tomas, selflessly sacrificed his well-being to drink a large free bear, and secure his team whatever extra credit was available.<\/p>\n<p>The Geekhalla Trivia Team:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jean-Luc &#8220;Eddie Murphy&#8221; Martel aka.
