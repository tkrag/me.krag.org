Well maybe a word, but that&#8217;s really it.<\/p>\n<p>To compensate for my obvious failings in that direction, I have decided not to learn how to drum either. Or cook Ghanaian style. Or weave Kente cloth. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just not cut out for it. I try. Well at least I try to convince myself I should try. At least.<br \/>\nThe fact is, I don&#8217;t really have the excess energy.<\/p>\n<p>Here I am, in a foreign country. A foreign business environment. Trying to make a positive impact to a company that does things in a different way, with different technology, and different goals. with different hopes, and different beliefs. Especially different beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>I get up at 6 in the morning. Do some basic excercises to try and keep my circulation going. Have a well-prepared breakfast of oatmeal and egg sandwiches (Thanks to Rose and Richard), before being picked up for a 40 minute drive through the chaos that is Accra rush-hour. At work, when i&#8217;m not trying to figure out the mysteries of linux firewalling, IP masquerading or Wireless microwave links, i&#8217;m probably on the road. The sweltering mid-day drive to find the radio-link and do some reconfiguring. 25km. Windows down to make the heat bearable, the dusty roads ensure that I am soon feeling the grains of sand between my teeth. <\/p>\n<p>\nAnd then there are the quiet periods. When I get time to send an e-mail to my girlfriend, my friends, my family, or to post another post on geekhalla. The time when I get a chance to really enjoy the, for Ghana, incredible 64Kbps connectivity that I work to keep up and running.<br \/>\nWhen work finishes, and at the end of another 40 minute drive, there is either exhaustion, or social activities.<br \/> The monday night <a href=\"http:\/\/www.harrier.org\/\">Hash House Harriers<\/a>, the wednesday night ethiopian buffet at Nuku&#8217;s. The Thursday Trivia night at Champs. The bar&#8217;s, restaurants, weekend trips to Cape Coast, Kumasi, Mole and wherever. The books I want to read. The showers I want to take. Yes, let&#8217;s not forget the showers, for they are one of the days absolute highlights, when there is an opportunity to wash away the dust and dried up sweat of a day of sweltering heat.<\/p>\n<p>After all this, I just can&#8217;t seem to prioritize Twi, cooking, drumming or any other of a long list of worthwhile pursuits that I had sworn to myself I would at least dip into while in Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>To all you cultural-immersion, &#8220;wring-every-last-drop-out-of-life&#8221; enthusiasts, I sincerely apologize. I guess I am a leisurely traveller.<br \/>\nOne that refuses to pretend to live like the locals. Refuses to pretend I have to find the cheapest dinner option, or the most authentic cultural experience. But alos one that likes to experience, even the little bits of Ghanaian life that I ingest through some form of osmosis. I may be nothing more than a rich ex-pat, who comes to Ghana to experience the life, but at a distance. Who eats the food when it suits him, and refrains when he prefers. Who enjoys the atmosphere of the ex-pat bars. The air-conditioned Italian restaurants that are well outside the budget of most of the local population. I confess. That, too is a part of me.<\/p>\n<p>For I am here, first and foremost, to try and impart some of my experiences in the Internet field, on some of the locals. To see if I can&#8217;t make that tiny difference to the local economy. I am also here to learn, suck-up, breathe and be enriched. To share the culture, to live a little corner of the life, and to have fun. And I&#8217;d rather feel a little of the local culture and understand it, than try to grasp it all in one giant bite, suffering terminal cultural indigestion for the months that follow.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll return to Denmark, richer, fuller and a better Human, even if I still won&#8217;t speak Twi&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Close to 4 weeks on the ground, and I still don&#8217;t speak Twi.
