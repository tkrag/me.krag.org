I&#8217;m currently on paternity leave, until January 1st, which neatly coincides with the end of my contract there. As to the reasons for leaving, well, we can chalk it down to frustrations over a lack of defined strategy, and some deep-felt disagreement about how to get the maximum impact from the available funding. I&#8217;m a passionate guy, and when it comes to passion and beliefs, probably not as compromising as I could be, and the founders have a very clear vision for what they want. Those 2 things collided. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into a lot more detail in a public forum, for what should be obvious reasons, but I will say that it&#8217;s been a frustrating summer, and that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s left Refugees United in the past few months.<\/p>\n<p>Refugees United is currently recruiting a new CEO, and I wish whomever that may be, the best of luck in the future. And I do, sincerely, hope that the vision (of providing a tool that empowers refugees to get involved in their own search for family) ultimately succeeds.<\/p>\n<p>As for what the future holds, a person I trust recently invited me to have a &#8220;speculative wander through future opportunities&#8221;, and I like that phrase so much that I think that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ll spend the next few months on. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After just over 2 years and some great successes, matched by some great frustrations, I finally decided to quit my job as CTO of Refugees United.
