Partially of course seeing Signe (my girlfriend) again. After 2 and a half months of thoughts and e-mails, her physical, real presence is incredible.<\/p>\n<p>But a large part of it is the simple fact that I am enjoying myself immensely here in Ghana. It&#8217;s really no one thing in particular that makes it so. Talk about cultural adaptation curves, going through down periods, and springing back up. That may be all it is. But i really enjoy myself here.<\/p>\n<p>The frustration at not teaching is still a continuous presence. The lack of understanding for what it is I am supposed to be doing here still fuels a lot of negative thoughts about the whole project. <\/p>\n<p>But underneath and beyond that, is a continuously growing enjoyment of life in Accra. The people I hang out with are interesting. I have made some good new friends, experienced a new country, and hung out.<\/p>\n<p>Hanging out may seem like a dull thing to do, when there is an entire continent for me to explore, when there are things to see, people to meet, experiences to have. When there is, in effect a million things to do. But hanging out also provides me the space to brood, to think, to live and to relate to these new friends.<\/p>\n<p>I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say, and managing to draw out into interminable incomprehensibility, is that I am having a great time in Accra. I am, in fact, plotting for strange reasons to return to this country at a later time. Thinking about obscure ploys and business plans that may involve contributing some more to the IT industry in this country. <\/p>\n<p> I thought I should make that clear. After reading through some of my earlier posts and realising that the picture they provide seems slightly disillusioned and  disheartened. That is as far from the truth as it can be.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, my time in Ghana has only strengthened my belief that digital divide issues are important, and that bridging that divide should always be a buzzing thought in the back of the mind of anyone who, through working in the IT industry, has contributed to digging the divide.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Charley, why?
