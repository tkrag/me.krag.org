The beer flows freely.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s incredible. <\/p>\n<p>My first few weeks back from Ghana the spring weather crept out and all my friends were yelling at me to come outside and enjoy the sun while it lasted.<\/p>\n<p>My response: &#8220;Why? It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s hot or anything!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I was so used to the intense heat of Accra, I almost laughed at the feeble attempts at spring&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Now summer has arrived, and with it the hottest weather. I&#8217;m back to enjoying it, even if most of my Ghanaian friends would be wearing sweaters and coats.<\/p>\n<p>I miss Accra. The life, the lifestyle and the people. I miss that feeling of being part of something important. I really felt i was. <\/p>\n<p>I was proud of being a GeekCorps team member. Proud to have been selected to help out.<\/p>\n<p>I really enjoyed it out there.<\/p>\n<p>I really enjoy it here now. I feel like I have a different perspective on things. A large picture of the world of IT and Internet. A better feeling for what it really is I&#8217;m doing, and some valuable knowledge about the emerging markets in the developing world.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t done much since returning home. I&#8217;ve been living of my savings, trying to minimize expenses. That&#8217;s given me time to gop through the initial steps of starting a company with a friend of mine, and given me time to wrap my mind around some other IT related concepts that might make a difference in the developing world. That Digital Divide seems to be stuck in my mind&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Well, for the rest of the summer I&#8217;ll probably be working for a small Dansih company that produces software for Mobile Applications. Messaging, Mobile Communities and the like. <\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve accepted lesser pay in exchange for the freedom to fidget, dream and think about what I can do in this Digital Divide space that GeekCorps introduced me to. I doubt I&#8217;ll make an impact on the world. Probably nothing will come of it, but the thoughts are there, the aspriations and the knowledge that the IT and Internet world is so much bigger than we think \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Finally a word for group 3:<\/p>\n<p>Above all, enjoy your stay&#8230;&#8230; (and good luck)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been 2 months back from Ghana&#8230;..
