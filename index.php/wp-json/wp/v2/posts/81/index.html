I seem to have a few options showing up, which gives me the luxury problem of choosing what to do. <\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a 2-3 month project which involves a lot of market surveying, product descriptions, partnering etc. in the mobile internet sphere, but which doesn&#8217;t pay that well. In effectthey&#8217;ll give me enough to live off, along with a percentage of the sales of this particular middleware product.<br \/>\nPros: It&#8217;s in the mobile Internet sphere. I trust these guys. It&#8217;s an interesting product, with potential, it would give me a little bit of time to worl on my own projects in parallel.<br \/>\nCons: The pays not that great \ud83d\ude42 And even though I don&#8217;t need much, It would be great to be able to afford a trip to Accra in Autumn.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a potential 5-6 month project in basic project management. That is, pretty interesting in terms of responsibility, but pretty standard and probably not going to propel me into outer space.<br \/>\nPros: The pay is amazing. It&#8217;s fairly interesting in terms of responsibility.<br \/>\nCons: It&#8217;s not in Mobile Internet or anywhere else in the sphere that involves itself with gadgets and new technology. That translates roughly to less fun. Also it would probably preclude me from working on other concepts in parallel.<\/p>\n<p>Have to make a decision this week.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Things seem to be happening&#8230;.
