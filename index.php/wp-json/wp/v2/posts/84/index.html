I had a great job at Icon, in charge of mobile Internet developments. A great salary and above all great colleagues. Nevertheless there were more and more days where I found myself wondering wether this was enough for me. Wether I was falling into the trap of work. Success means fullfillment in a sense, and it gives me strength to work harder, just for the feeling of knowing you are good at what you&#8217;re doing. In a way it is a desire to at least try and see if there is more in life.<br \/>\nI was good at what I did, and still am, mind you, and that gave me some satisfaction. I had great colleagues, fun, interesting, intelligent and challenging, in fact Imiss them now that I work alone, and that made my days exciting. But I missed feeling a pride in what I was doing. I wanted, and still want to be doing something special. To be trying something a little different than what everyone else is trying. Maybe I just need to see myself stand out in the crowd. Maybe it&#8217;s just narcissism, but there you are.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, that that fine summer evening, I was at work late, and my brother mailed me a link to an <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/features\/00\/05\/25\/2259239.shtml\">article<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slashdot.org\/\">Slashdot<\/a>. It was a tale of a small start-up working in the highly unusual field of bridging the digital divide. It told the story of how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekcorps.org\/\">GeekCorps<\/a>, a North Adams, Mass.-based NGO, was going to send IT specialists as volunteers to Africa.<br \/>\nNow, ever since I travelled South Amarica for 6 months back in 1997, I have been fascinated by 3rd world problems. I have often thought of volunteering, even starting my own projects to help. The volunteering never happened, because I felt that as an IT specialist, it was futile to volunteer for a well-building or water-sanitation project, and the part about my own projects never happened because, well, I don&#8217;t have what it takes to be a pioneer. But I had often said, and even <a href=\"http:\/\/search.atomz.com\/search\/?sp-q=volunteer&#038;sp-a=0006345c-sp00000000\">written on this very site<\/a>, that I wanted to volunteer, if I could find something that made sense to me professionally.<br \/>\nAnd there it was. GeekCorps, it seemed, was exactly the kind of organisation I would have dreamed up, if I&#8217;d had the guts and the creativity to do it.<br \/>\nSo there I was, in my office in Copenhagen, on a spur of the moment decision, filling out an on-line application, to leave comfy Copenhagen behind and spend 3 months, doing god-knows-what in a country I knew nothing about. Oh, and looking over my shoulder to make sure my boss didn&#8217;t see me.<\/p>\n<p>After that I more or less forgot about it for a while. Spent 4 weeks on vacation travelling through Mexico with my girlfriend, and kept doing the same old work. Until one day in october, when a sudden e-mail from GeekCorps meant I had to make up my mind, should I go or should I stay.<br \/>\nA tough decision at the time, what with my girlfriend having just been away in Germany for 3 months, me being about 85% of the way towards starting a company with 3 friends of mine, and all the other more practical things that such a decision brings on.<br \/>\nHaving dreamed of something for years and having promised yourself &#8220;if only there was a way&#8230;&#8221; is such a catalyst for this type of decision though. I knew I had to do it, or I&#8217;d be forever asking myself how it might have been.<\/p>\n<p>From that day on was a race of immunizations, getting rid of my apartment, packing, moving, quitting my job (not too popular that one) and generally busying myself with all sorts of arcane preparations.<br \/>\nAnd one Sunday in mid-January my flight left from Copenhagen, via Iceland to JFK and NYC, where I was to meet up with 3 fellow volunteers, and get on the train to Albany. The adventure had begun.<\/p>\n<p>At that time, I still had no clue of what I was going to be doing, with whom and under what circumstances. I knew the name of the company (AfricaExpress) I was to work with, as well as a few key-words regarding technology. But it was enough&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>In brief the whole idea was to get 2 weeks of training in North Adams, Mass. followed by 3 months in Accra working with a partner in a local business in an attempt to transfer as much knowledge as possible in the 3 months available. Oh, and have fun in the proccess.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the place for me to describe the 3 months, what happened and why, for that you should probably have a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekhalla.org\/\">GeekHalla<\/a>, our on-line diary while we were there.<\/p>\n<p>Instead I wanted to write this to attempt to answer some of the questions I have gotten since returning to Copenhagen almost 3 months ago.<\/p>\n<p>Many people ask me the same question: <b>Did you achieve your goals?<\/b> <i>(asked in a fairly sceptical voice)<br \/>\nThe answer of course, like with so many things, is an emphatic <b>yes<\/b> and <b>no<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Did I do everything I hope to do? Did I pass on as much knowledge as I believed possible, in the given 3 months time period?<br \/>\n<b> NO!<\/b> not even close.<br \/>\nDid I get things done? Help my partner company? Make a difference?<br \/>\nI believe I did.<br \/>\nWas it personally enriching? am I a better person now? Has it increased my long-term involvement in Digital Divide issues?<br \/>\nBeyond a reasonable doubt, I&#8217;d say.<\/p>\n<p>The problems in such a venture are huge. The key to GeekCorps is Knowledge Transfer. The idea that you can take a geek from his\/her comfortable home, somewhere in the Western world. A specialist in a field with fairly large labour shortages. An expensive commodity. You dump this geek into the private sector somewhere in the developing world. In a company that needs and wants that skill-set. And you sit him down for three months with an individual, and ask them to solve a problem, or build a system together. The knowledge that will pas between 2 people working together like that, with a common goal, for 3 months, is knowledge that is almost impossible for the Company to get in any other way. <\/p>\n<p>In an ideal world the results are manifold.<br \/>\n1. Your original geek, who may be stressed out to destruction in a business that seeems to have little respect for the individual in the eternal fight for growth, gets a needed break. In Ghana,a s in may developing countries, the pace is different, the need to be faster, stronger and better is a lot less, and even having an impossible project to finish in 3 months stress is not an issue.<br \/>\n2. That same original western-minded geek, hopefully goes through the 3 months in Africa as an eye-opening experience. He\/she will learn about other cultures, get a feeling for the other side of Africa, the one that isn&#8217;t famines, civil war, AIDS and terrorism, and maybe even be infected with a longer lasting desire to help.<br \/>\n3. The local partner company, ideally, gets a small competance boost. A boost that, as I mentioned, is almost impossible to get in a country where many Computer Science Graduates have never actually had access computers at university.<br \/>\n4. The individual employee<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the past few months, many people have asked me about my trip to Africa.
