By individuals, by governments (western as well as others) and by organisations (those considered terrorist as well as many considered tolerant). Only rarely do I read about actions taken and words spoken that live up to my values.<\/p>\n<p>I am not doing anyone a favour by keeping those values to myself.<\/p>\n<p>Working a &#8220;normal&#8221; job in the IT industry is rewarding in many ways.<br \/>\nSo far it has paid well, it&#8217;s been fun, it&#8217;s allowed me to work with great people, and challenged myself intellectually.<br \/>\nBut it&#8217;s hardly a clear cut channel for my values. <\/p>\n<p>But my work is such an important part of my identity that more often that not, I forget my values in my quest to be confirmed in that identity.<br \/>\nI want to be good at what I do, because I get a lot of satisfaction from that positive feedback.<br \/>\nBecause my job is so important to my identity, I need to be constantly confirmed that I do it well. <\/p>\n<p>But am I proud to go out there and say, I&#8217;m a damn good consultant in Mobile Internet? Not in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I am trying to redefine not who I am, but who I am perceived to be.<br \/>\nI&#8217;d rather be thought of as <i>&#8220;that idealistic, naive socialist who thinks he can actually change anything in the world&#8221;<\/i>, than <i>&#8220;that excellent IT consultant with the general skills and the great understanding of business and technology&#8221;<\/i> or whatever it is they think about me. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m proud to live in Denmark for a variety of reasons.<br \/>\nMost of those reasons involve the fact that the Danish system places a high priority on maintaining a financially equal society where the difference between rich and poor is amongst the smallest in the world.<br \/>\nThis seems to make people think of us as a socialist. If socialism is what makes it so, and socialism is what ensures that we are one of the countries spending the largest proportion of GDP on foreign aid, so be it.<\/p>\n<p>I am less proud of being Danish when it comes to integration.<br \/>\nThe right-wing parties that seem to want to declare a general ban on Islam, rather than think about how to succesfully integrate people with different cultural backgrounds.<br \/>\nThe outspoken fanatics that seem willing to pick up the rocks, throw them at muslim stores and burn down the mosques, in a horrid &#8220;Krystalnacht&#8221; type scenario.<br \/>\nThe few fanatical danes, that just like the few fanatical muslims, are relaying the wrong picture of the masses.<br \/>\nThey scare me. <\/p>\n<p>I keep returning in my mind to the nightmare scenario. What if a terrorist attack were to hit the danish parliament?<br \/>\nWould there be enough danes to march through the streets, smash the windows of muslim stores, and burn down the mosques.<br \/>\nAnd what support would that kind of action get with the general public. <\/p>\n<p>How far are we away from that kind of scenario? Not far enough in my opinion.<\/p>\n<p>I want to do something. I want my actions to represent my values in some sense. I want to be able to say that I, for one, am not complacent. But I&#8217;m not sure I have the will, the courage and the balls to do it. <\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ll give it a try \ud83d\ude42 Wish me luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes the world strikes me as an evil, superficial and generally less than optimal place to be.
