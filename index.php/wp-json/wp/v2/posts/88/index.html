My conclusion is that that probably isn&#8217;t what I really want to be doing.<br \/>\nI&#8217;m thinking about taking a slightly longer contract, working full-time as a project manager or technical project manager. Try to challenge myself again, work in a team, on a project with a tangible target. Developp something, and make more money in the process. <\/p>\n<p>Although it feels really good to have an idea for a non-profit, working with interesting technology, tackling a real-world problem (the Digital Divide), it&#8217;s not going to pay my bills for quite some time. I need something else to do that brings in money. In the meantime, I need to develop the idea for our little Digital Divide project, look for funding, research and build up the necessary contacts. It&#8217;s a tough combination, but I see little choice but to try and combine full-time work with art-time idealism, no matter how naive or plain silly it sounds in my own ears. <\/p>\n<p>I hope to be able to tell you more about my idealism and specific plans soon. I just need to write it down \ud83d\ude42<br \/>\nThe good part about working on a non-profit is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about someone stealing your plans. In fact if I caould make someone steal my plans and implement them, that would be an almost perfect success. So no NDA&#8217;s, no lawyer talk, just plain old ideas and inspiration.<br \/>\nThe bad side of course is thatnon-profit, means non-profit.<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230; My grandfather just told me yesterday, that nobody should expect to be rich before they&#8217;re 40. Rich in terms of family, experiences, memories, love, and the ability to afford a good comfortable lifestyle. That gives me years to live out my idealist dreams, and then some more years to try and make the money. No hurries then. I&#8217;m cool!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just wrote a medium long post about life, pressed the wrong button and voila&#8230; disparu&#8230;.
