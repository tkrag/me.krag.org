There are 3 things that cause me not to sign and forward this.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, I am sceptical of the effect of this type of thing, and sceptical of the need to bulk mail this type of message. I will, in principal, only sign such things when I personally know, or someone I trust, knows the person collecting and delivering these statements. Otherwise, there is simply too high a chance that it is a fraud, it will be misrepresented or otherwise abused.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, I am convinced that the United Nations knows and accepts that people all over the world (including myself) are horrified by the treatment of women in Afghanistan. They don&#8217;t need an e-mail petition to tell them.<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, and probably most importantly, I think the way the international media is singling out Afghanistan as opposed to other countries is atrocious. The fervour to ally itself with Russia, well knowing that Russian Human Rights Violations in Chechnya are insane. The sudden desire to become a close ally with Afghanistans neighbour Uzbekistan, although Uzbekistan is one of the largest oppressors of Human Rights in the world. Lead by an effective state dictator, bigotry, oppression of women and imprisonment and execution of the opposition, as well as other problems are rife in Uzbek society. These are only a few examples of the US allying itself with nations harbouring terrorists, and having a less than perect human rights record (Syria and Iran are suddenly becoming friends of G.W.B.) Yet, in it&#8217;s war against one particular terrorist, and one particular breach of Human Rights, the US (and EU) is allying itself with nations that in no way support the message that this is a war against terrorism as a whole, and against Human Rights breaches as a whole.<br \/>\nI cannot accept that kind of political maneauvering and lying by the US government, anymore than I can accept it of my own.<\/p>\n<p>If this is a war against Human Rights breaches and terrorism world-wide it is paramount that George W. Bush and his western allies make it clear that they will not accept the bombings of Chechnya (unconditionally) or the human rights breaches of Pakistan, Uzbekistan and others. Unfortunately they aren&#8217;t willing to do that, because this is effecively a war against the Taleban and Ossama bin Laden, and NOT a war against Terrorism.<br \/>\n<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wrote this answer to a petition against violations of womens rights in Afghanistan: I&#8217;m sorry.
