That&#8217;s where my heart lies (at least for now). I&#8217;m still working on a project proposal for a non-profit project together with a former colleague of mine. We&#8217;re planning to look into redesigning and recombining existing technology to make it more suitable for developing world applications. Part of that project involves builing a web-site that allows people working with connectivity and Internet in the developing world can exchange ideas, review products, ask questions and identify problem areas. You know. Input for us &#8220;thinkers&#8221;&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also looking into what it would take to go back to university and do some research\/graduate studies on digital divide issues, Internet technology in the developing world and other interesting stuff. There really isn&#8217;t anything going on in academia back here in Denmark, so my research, and considerations are mostly about the possibility of going to the US to study for a year or two. The Digital Nations program at MIT\/Harvard is the center of my attention. But it&#8217;s incredibly difficult to get a clear picture of what it would take, what it would cost, and if it&#8217;s even within the realm of possibilites in terms of admission, financing, and personal sacrifice.<br \/>\nSo that takes a fair bit of my time as well. <\/p>\n<p>On saturday, I&#8217;m off to Barcelona, Spain and Perpignan, France for 5 days, with my girlfriend. She has a few meetings in Perpignan, and I had some frequent flyer miles from back when I was still employed. And we never did get to have any vacation together this summer. So even though I&#8217;m not making any money at the moment, it&#8217;ll be nice to get away for a few days, to a hopefully friendlier climate, and one of my absolute favourite cities in Europe (Barcelona).<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.falconbasket.dk\/\">basketball<\/a> season has started, and although my slightly flawed knee (torn and inadequately repaired anterior cruciate ligament), sometimes complains, it&#8217;s so good to play again. Especially since we&#8217;ve won the first 2 games of our season. And I&#8217;ve started working out at the local fitness center. Mostly to get in shape, and strengthen that knee. It feels good to move that body, that feels older than it did a few years ago. Is that strange?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mostly spending my time looking for consultancy gigs for myself and my business partner in Mostly Harmless.
