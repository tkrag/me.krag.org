I brought our 2 cinema chairs with us, and they were extremely comfy. We played Overthrown (some obscure card-game, with a rulebook with the size and comprehensibility of &#8220;The Silmarillion&#8221;). I won.<br \/>\nLot&#8217;s of visitors. Amongst them Kim (replacing Jens for a few hours) and bringing with him loads of piping hot home-made Lasagne (Insert appropriate superlatives), and San, my friend of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cphpost.dk\/\">Copenhagen Post<\/a> fame.<br \/>\nWe played Cranium, a simple, yet fun game mixing TP, Pictionary, a crossword puzzle, and humming karaoke. I should have won (with Kim).<br \/>\nIt rained a little. We crept under the overhanf. It stopped raining.<br \/>\nWe went to sleep, dressed in enormous amounts of sweaters, sleeping-bags and blankets. While the wind in my face was slightly chilly, in general I was very warm and comfortable. <\/p>\n<p>We woke up, and more people dropped by with rolls and cheese (Lars), Danish Pastries (Signe) and piping coffee and home-baked croissants (Big Brother).<\/p>\n<p>We were number 68-72 in the queue. At max. 8 tickets a person in a 1100 seater theatre, that meant decent tickets. And we got them. So while we are now looking forward to the 19th December at 01:00, last night was enjoyable in itself. We don&#8217;t often get to spend time, relaxing, playing games and talking together. Especially not with Lasagne delivery of that quality.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who took part and brought us good things to eat.<br \/>\nAnd thanks also to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gladblad.dk\/lotr\/\">the guys <\/a>that made sure the queue was kept orderly and no line-skipping chaos broke out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, spent the night on a Copenhagen pavement, at about 9 degrees Centigrade.
