I have lot&#8217;s of experience speaking at conferences, giving presentations, and generally listening to myself talk. This time however, I have no idea how many people will be there, what their additudes might be, and wether or not they really care about these issues. Also, I suddenly realize how appalingly little I actually know about these issues. My education is in IT and Economy, my proffessional experience is as a project manager, programmer, technical something-or-other and middle manager. That is until I mysteriously dissapeared to Ghana for 3 months. Apart from that stay, a 2 week training period before that, and my general interest in travelling, reading, and knowing-it-all, I really don&#8217;t have a clue. <\/p>\n<p>But I do know that these are issues that mean a lot more to me than most of what I&#8217;ve worked with so far. And I do spend a considerable amount of time at the moment, reading up o  these issues, thinking about the applicability of projects like GeekCorps, and discussing many of these things with other interested people. It get&#8217;s me somewhere. <\/p>\n<p>Well, as part of my seminar tomorrow, I&#8217;ve decided to make a subsection of this site at <a href=\"http:\/\/digdiv.krag.org\/\">http:\/\/digdiv.krag.org\/<\/a>.<br \/>\nHere I&#8217;ll keep a link section pointing to other organisations in the field, put up soem documents for download, and maybe even write a little about my perspective. But don&#8217;t expect too much. It&#8217;s hard enough for me to keep this page updated, without having to worry about other things. I&#8217;ll try!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi there, I&#8217;m sitting at my desk working on a seminar\/speech I&#8217;m giving tomorrow at my old university study programme, D\u00d8K.
